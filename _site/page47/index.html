        <p>Once again, the people have presented me with something that I can’t live without anymore. A member one day asked the forums if anybody was using <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>, and his answers must have disappointed him lots. There were both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<blockquote>What the hell is twitter?</blockquote>
<p>Right down to:</p>
<blockquote>FAG!</blockquote>
<p>I was mostly confused about this new thing, so I decided to check it out. At first, the layout of the site and the crap and chinese characters that were displayed across the page. I still didn’t get it. Then, I decided to actually read what was written. Then, I clicked. But what kind of turbogeek would want to update something at least once a day just to tell the web what he was doing? Who stayed in front of his computer enough to get an occasion to update this?</p>

        <p>You know what? Forget everthing that I wrote about class variables, I was totally off on what concerned the setting of those variables. Here is the scoop: you cannot, even with $this-&gt;, $this:: or the static keyword prefixing your variables, SET them. I repeat, you can declare a variable but you can not attribute a value to it directly between the classe’s curly brackets. In fact, everything that is considered an operation, like incrementing a global which is not even a member to the class, will yeild an unexpected T_VARIABLE error, causing many frustrations for the OO PHP beginner who doesn’t know this.</p>

        <p>I’m just a couple of days back from a trip in Alberta as a part of student exchange. This trip gave us a lot of opportunities to discover a whole different culture and lifestyle. A culture lifestyle full of steak, oil, and cellphones. Steak and oil, I can get over, but cellphones, not. Having those awesome pieces of coolness flashed around me every moment of the day by pretty much everyone (a 10 year old girl on a bus had a Razr. <em>JAWDROP</em>) was just too much for me. On our way back, in the numerous cell phone company booths that the West Edmonton Mall had to offer, I begun checking out how much one of the those brain-tumor generators would cost.  I got a rough idea other there, and right back at home, I shopped the intertubes for some decent phones and the plans to go with them. I pretty much decided that I was going to take the Telus Talk-to-me 25 package, with 100 all time minutes, 1000 nights and weekends, and unlimited incoming calls for 25$ a month, plus the unlimited text messaging, which is 10 more bucks per month, plus of course all those standard bullshit hidden fee stuff.</p>

<p>It’s been only a few weeks since my first venture in OO PHP (which for some weird reason looks pretty obscure), and already I have found something that is very sparsely documented, or at least not very easy to find for the common noob.</p>

        <p>Just a few weeks ago, I was a hardcore <a href="http://apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a> fan. It’s organized, clean, easy to use,  I used to say. I liked it so much, that all the boxes in my home capable of running it had it as their default media player, nothing else was considered. According to me a few weeks ago,  if you wanted to play media, it had to be done in the right media player: iTunes, and nothing else.</p>
