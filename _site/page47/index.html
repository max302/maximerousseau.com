        <p>A few days ago, I was all excited about it: I was ordering my first piece of clothes from the mighty interweb. I had been dreaming for long of the day where I could wear shirts that nowhere understood, shirts that declared publicly that I could smoke your ass in a game of W:ET. <a href="http://thinkgeek.com">ThinkGeek</a> is one of my friends’ favorites, and they do have really cool code and development orientated shirts, but for me, more of a gamer type, I prefer <a href="http://jinx.com">Jinx</a>. I had been salivating over many of the Jinx shirts, and that day, I was about to file my very first order.</p>

        <p>Before, like all noob worthy of that appellation, back in the days where I had no friends (on the internet),  I used to live with one soul instant messaging client, that is MSN Messenger. Of course, from age ten and later, I got a bit better at my practices and downloaded a bit of extensions and tweaks, amongst those were the very famous Messenger Plus and several of the plugins available for it. For Messenger versions 6 &amp; 7, I was pretty much hooked on <a href="http://www.msgpluslive.net/">Messenger Plus</a>. Of course, sometimes I would go wild in one of my Linux/Open source follies, and I ended up trying several remakes of messenger clients, amongst which many browser-based clients like <a href="http://www.ebuddy.com/">eBuddy</a> and <a href="http://meebo.com">Meebo</a>, and eventual, I stumbled upon Gaim, probably the most known cross-platform, cross-protocol, plugin-extensible messenger client out there. For me and at that time, it was wonderful for  two reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It could support numerous logins on numerous protocols, something that I really found cool be really never used.</li>
	<li>It was open source, which back in the day was an incentive by itself. If it was open source but I didn't need it, I had it anyways, just because I thought it was cool supporting GNU and GPL and stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these two reasons, several features, or lack of features, made me uninstall Gaim, stuff like the raw ugliness of the buddy list, those cheesy, old-skool, Gnome-style icons, which for reason I couldn’t bare, and the lack of support for the brand new funky feature on MSN Messenger 7, “personal messages”, that customizable sub-nickname that could display what tune you were listening to. I thought that this new feature was essential, so I ditched it, and went back to my old habits.</p>

        <p>Once again, the people have presented me with something that I can’t live without anymore. A member one day asked the forums if anybody was using <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>, and his answers must have disappointed him lots. There were both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<blockquote>What the hell is twitter?</blockquote>
<p>Right down to:</p>
<blockquote>FAG!</blockquote>
<p>I was mostly confused about this new thing, so I decided to check it out. At first, the layout of the site and the crap and chinese characters that were displayed across the page. I still didn’t get it. Then, I decided to actually read what was written. Then, I clicked. But what kind of turbogeek would want to update something at least once a day just to tell the web what he was doing? Who stayed in front of his computer enough to get an occasion to update this?</p>

        <p>You know what? Forget everthing that I wrote about class variables, I was totally off on what concerned the setting of those variables. Here is the scoop: you cannot, even with $this-&gt;, $this:: or the static keyword prefixing your variables, SET them. I repeat, you can declare a variable but you can not attribute a value to it directly between the classe’s curly brackets. In fact, everything that is considered an operation, like incrementing a global which is not even a member to the class, will yeild an unexpected T_VARIABLE error, causing many frustrations for the OO PHP beginner who doesn’t know this.</p>

        <p>I’m just a couple of days back from a trip in Alberta as a part of student exchange. This trip gave us a lot of opportunities to discover a whole different culture and lifestyle. A culture lifestyle full of steak, oil, and cellphones. Steak and oil, I can get over, but cellphones, not. Having those awesome pieces of coolness flashed around me every moment of the day by pretty much everyone (a 10 year old girl on a bus had a Razr. <em>JAWDROP</em>) was just too much for me. On our way back, in the numerous cell phone company booths that the West Edmonton Mall had to offer, I begun checking out how much one of the those brain-tumor generators would cost.  I got a rough idea other there, and right back at home, I shopped the intertubes for some decent phones and the plans to go with them. I pretty much decided that I was going to take the Telus Talk-to-me 25 package, with 100 all time minutes, 1000 nights and weekends, and unlimited incoming calls for 25$ a month, plus the unlimited text messaging, which is 10 more bucks per month, plus of course all those standard bullshit hidden fee stuff.</p>
