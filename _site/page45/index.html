        <p>Recently, I was looking for reviews for stuff such as the Motorola L2 and the Nikon D40, and after a few seconds of Googling I quickly found ¸a site dedicated to offering visitors such reviews, that is Epinions. You might have seen my two recent articles where I mentioned that they were originally posted on Epininons, well here is what that is all about.</p>

        <p>Like all other geeks who enjoy technology in every form, I was very pleased to see something as revolutionary as the iPhone come out. For a while before it’s release, some fools in my class were talking about buying one, although it was clear that this wouldn’t happen, and my friends and I discussed how great this was gonna be. I would browse digg like I always do and then get to see a couple of articles of the iPhone, I would read and digg, then move on to regular news, like GPLv3, Net Neutrality, distro releases, ect.</p>

        <p>I bought this computer a couple of months ago as my first computer. I had decided that I wanted something compact, something that I could bring to school, to my friend’s house, while I’m out of the house, I wanted mobility, with still enough power for gaming and multi-tasking, and this is exactly what this laptop gave me.</p>

        <blockquote>WARNING! This post may contain political views which might offend you. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.</blockquote>
<p>Here we are, two days from the St. Jean Baptist, Quebec’s provincial holiday. Still today, even after it’s over, I can feel the excitement that is usually caused by a event of the kind, and I don’t mean the hangover that ensued after the traditional celebrations. The St. Jean usually has many side-effects, like the installation of our province’s flag on many cars, public display of the said flag, and an unexplained amount of patriotism amongst the general population, patriotism which sometimes results in the temporary loss of one’s commonsense which transforms the affected person into what looks and sounds like a temporary separatist. During the 4 - 7 day period which includes a few days before and after the 25th of June, some people start to behave like separatists, through behavior such as the excess use of the phrase “Vive le Quebec libre!”, which roughly translates in “Long-live free Quebec!”. In this time of the year, it’s seems like everybody is talking about the “NATIONAL” holiday, and how we will celebrate our “NATION” everywhere, including places like Montreal and Quebec (which according to it’s welcome sign is the “NATIONAL” capital). This excessive display of either ignorant or very separatist-like behavior has only but fed the flame that is my conservative Federalism, and I find that this is a nice time to write the Federalist rant that I have been wanting to write for a while.</p>

        <p>This is it, after a month and a half of paperwork, interviews, and waiting for a call, I finally started working for the big M. I have read, and you have probably too, all of the junk on ther internet, stuff like “I work at McD and it’s prison”,  well forget all of that. After almost completing my trainings, I have forged myself a whole other view of my newfound job, one far from what says the internet.</p>
