It's organized, clean, easy to use,  I used to say. I liked it so much, that all the boxes in my home capable of running it had it as their default media player, nothing else was considered. According to me a few weeks ago,  if you wanted to play media, it had to be done in the right media player: iTunes, and nothing else.\\n\\nBut along come <a href=\\\"http://tylerjameslee.com\\\">Tyler</a>, and announces that he has found a replacement for iTunes. At first, I couldn't believe it: look, nothing even comes close to beating iTunes. But after fighting with my favorite media player to get to read media on a new removable hard drive properly, I decided to download and test the new player, which at the time of download was and still is in a very early beta phase, at version 0.2.5. It is called<a href=\\\"http://www.songbirdnest.com/\\\"> SongBird</a>. My motivations were the following: my iPod was supported, and that it was totally cross-platform and looked more flexible than iTunes, very useful for using the same player on my future Mac and not messing stuff up each time I change my drive`s host.  At first, I was a bit reluctant to install it: what if it interfered with my precious (and ever so easily corruptible) iTunes library files? Then, I went bonkers and commited the unthinkable: I said F this whole iTunes shit, let it burn in hell, I`ll just reorganize me music once more.\\n\\nSo there I was, on a Saturday afternoon, changing media players, stressing out, thinking that I would probably loose some of my music (the database mess-up incident was still pretty close), when in the end, it was super easy, because I had forgotten that not every media player works with strict library files like iTunes does. My install and media import experience was wonderful, that is if you not count the 15 or so ID3 track infos that weren't recognized.  That's when I begun exploring the features of Songbird.\\n\\nThere too, I was impressed. This thing is just like iTunes, I told to myself, but only better.  Look, it`s amazing; it has an integrated browser powered on the <a href=\\\"http://getfirefox.com\\\">Firefox</a> engine (&lt;3 FF!) improved streaming media functions that actually remembers the radio stations that you access earlier, and even that cool auto-playlist feature <strike>copied</strike> inspired right from iTunes. Remember, this is still REALLY beta software too. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.\\n\\nI should remind you that this is almost totally cross-platform, support Windows, OS X and all the flavors of Linux, maybe even BSD with a little bit of hacking. The only inconvenience that I found is that it seems to manage resources even worst than most recent iTunes, chomping on the RAM like I never thought a media player could.\\n\\nQuestion yourself no more,  I you want to get rid of iTunes, and even if you don't, Songbird is something that you should check out. In a sentence, it's kind of a hybrid between WinAmp and iTunes and since it's opensource, there is room o' plenty for it grow and become the best media player out there, becoming somewhat the Firefox of music and video.

This post may contain political views which might offend you. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.</blockquote>\\nHere we are, two days from the St. Jean Baptist, Quebec's provincial holiday. Still today, even after it's over, I can feel the excitement that is usually caused by a event of the kind, and I don't mean the hangover that ensued after the traditional celebrations. The St. Jean usually has many side-effects, like the installation of our province's flag on many cars, public display of the said flag, and an unexplained amount of patriotism amongst the general population, patriotism which sometimes results in the temporary loss of one's commonsense which transforms the affected person into what looks and sounds like a temporary separatist. During the 4 - 7 day period which includes a few days before and after the 25th of June, some people start to behave like separatists, through behavior such as the excess use of the phrase \\\"Vive le Quebec libre!\\\", which roughly translates in \\\"Long-live free Quebec!\\\". In this time of the year, it's seems like everybody is talking about the \\\"NATIONAL\\\" holiday, and how we will celebrate our \\\"NATION\\\" everywhere, including places like Montreal and Quebec (which according to it's welcome sign is the \\\"NATIONAL\\\" capital). This excessive display of either ignorant or very separatist-like behavior has only but fed the flame that is my conservative Federalism, and I find that this is a nice time to write the Federalist rant that I have been wanting to write for a while.\\n\\nFirst, I would like to give you a little bit of background on my political life. I am the male, English speaking child of two somewhat conservative but otherwise politically un-orientated, French-mother-tongued parents, with the rest of my father's side family being mostly separatist. If you are a regular reader of my blog (thanks a lot for reading) you might already know that I am well under the legal age for voting, which means that I have not yet voted for anything, might it be provincial or federal, or even municipal. However, thanks to my parents and some high-school teachers which gave me a lot of political base knowledge in my early teens, and to the fact that I have been reading the paper (almost) every day and watching the news just as often has made me very inclined to following political campaigns with lots of interest. So, for the last provincial and federal elections (maybe more, but with a bit less interest), I have been watching and reading everything that I possibly could about political campaigns and their participants, analyzing everything I could, honing my critical skills. These two campaigns, along with the many discussions that I have with my parents, teachers and friends, were enough to forge my political opinion to the indestructible piece of Federalist conservative granite that it has become. Most of the people I spend most of my time with, being my classmates, work buddies and related parents can testify that I deep down inside of me I have always been a conservative: I hate change, prefer the security of what is known and gentle progressivism to radical changes, and that applies everywhere, from my haircut to my playing style in RTS games. As for the Federalist part, my views in the next few paragraphs is pretty sure to enlighten you.\\n\\nSo back to separatists. For the last couple of years, I have come to the conclusion that the province of Quebec, it's inhabitants and it's government, or at least some of the contestants for the latter, can be metaphorically compared to an overzealous youngster: we are the weakest link in the chain that is our country, yet we permit ourselves to comment about the federal's every practice, and when things aren't going the way we want, we try to ignore the rest of the country and separate, thinking that our meager economy is enough to compensate for the loss of all infrastructures currently owned by the Canadian government. Like a teen stuck right in it's teenage crisis, we want freedom and recognition just for ourselves, just because some people think we can afford it, we refuse cooperation. The feds are ripping us off they say, taking our federal tax money for the extraction of tar sands in Alberta. This is one thing that separatists don't seem to understand: today, a country has to be run like a business, and I personally don't know a business which would invest in something that won't yield, IE the province of Quebec, home of hydroelectricity and employment rates well under the Canadian average.\\n\\nThis brings me to another point: the stubbornness of my province in relative to their culture and language. Let go of the freaking culture will you. Yes, I know, our provincial motto is \\\"I remember\\\", but how about remembering and letting go of these stupid habits of \\\"protecting\\\" our native language by banning everything english we can possibly get away with. In this North American world of Anglos, we refuse to submit to the defacto, which would open many doors in profitable sectors, and instead we let our children go through high-school without getting appropriate English language education, making them unprepared for the outside world, confining them to this province they call a nation, which it too is being overrun with Anglo immigrants, as can testify Montreal.\\n\\nI just can not stand this over-patriotism that lots of people display, specially in this time of the year. I don't want to make myself look superior to everybody else here, but it looks to me that some people just adhere to the separatist crowd without even knowing what it implies, too often have I seen people my age not give a shit about politics and then proudly announce that they were for the separation of our oh so \\\"STRONG\\\" \\\"NATION\\\". I think that everybody needs a reality check: in the eternal search for a peaceful, smooth running country and province, cooperation is the key, like in pretty much everything else. Stop calling Quebec a nation, it's not, never will be, or will die trying to. Don't people even learn what happens when a government restructures? I haven't live long enough to see lots of those, but historically, we have a good chance of falling into poverty and civil war for quite a long time with such a restructure.\\n\\nSo how about pleasing me and putting that flag down for a second, and think seriously about what being a nation implies. Stop blaming it all on the feds, it's about time that we take our responsibilities and get our act straight before we can complain. The sad truth is that Canada can continue (not without some changes, but it can) without Quebec, but Quebec cannot without Canada. I am not telling you to ditch all pride for your province, I love my province too, but don't go overboard with it, separation is just not an option.\\n\\nAnd that was my political rant. If you disagree or agree in any way, I invite you to discuss it in the comments, in the language that suits you, may it be French or English.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>WARNING!

This post may contain political views which might offend you. Don't\ntell me I didn't warn you.\nHere we are, two days from the St. Jean Baptist, Quebec's provincial holiday.\nStill today, even after it's over, I can feel the excitement that is usually\ncaused by a event of the kind, and I don't mean the hangover that ensued after\nthe traditional celebrations. The St. Jean usually has many side-effects, like\nthe installation of our province's flag on many cars, public display of the said\nflag, and an unexplained amount of patriotism amongst the general population,\npatriotism which sometimes results in the temporary loss of one's commonsense\nwhich transforms the affected person into what looks and sounds like a temporary\nseparatist. During the 4 - 7 day period which includes a few days before and\nafter the 25th of June, some people start to behave like separatists, through\nbehavior such as the excess use of the phrase \"Vive le Quebec libre!\", which\nroughly translates in \"Long-live free Quebec!\". In this time of the year, it's\nseems like everybody is talking about the \"NATIONAL\" holiday, and how we will\ncelebrate our \"NATION\" everywhere, including places like Montreal and Quebec\n(which according to it's welcome sign is the \"NATIONAL\" capital). This excessive\ndisplay of either ignorant or very separatist-like behavior has only but fed the\nflame that is my conservative Federalism, and I find that this is a nice time to\nwrite the Federalist rant that I have been wanting to write for a while.First, I\nwould like to give you a little bit of background on my political life. I am the\nmale, English speaking child of two somewhat conservative but otherwise\npolitically un-orientated, French-mother-tongued parents, with the rest of my\nfather's side family being mostly separatist. If you are a regular reader of my\nblog (thanks a lot for reading) you might already know that I am well under the\nlegal age for voting, which means that I have not yet voted for anything, might\nit be provincial or federal, or even municipal. However, thanks to my parents\nand some high-school teachers which gave me a lot of political base knowledge in\nmy early teens, and to the fact that I have been reading the paper (almost)\nevery day and watching the news just as often has made me very inclined to\nfollowing political campaigns with lots of interest. So, for the last provincial\nand federal elections (maybe more, but with a bit less interest), I have been\nwatching and reading everything that I possibly could about political campaigns\nand their participants, analyzing everything I could, honing my critical skills.\nThese two campaigns, along with the many discussions that I have with my\nparents, teachers and friends, were enough to forge my political opinion to the\nindestructible piece of Federalist conservative granite that it has become. Most\nof the people I spend most of my time with, being my classmates, work buddies\nand related parents can testify that I deep down inside of me I have always been\na conservative: I hate change, prefer the security of what is known and gentle\nprogressivism to radical changes, and that applies everywhere, from my haircut\nto my playing style in RTS games. As for the Federalist part, my views in the\nnext few paragraphs is pretty sure to enlighten you.\n\nSo back to separatists. For the last couple of years, I have come to the\nconclusion that the province of Quebec, it's inhabitants and it's government, or\nat least some of the contestants for the latter, can be metaphorically compared\nto an overzealous youngster: we are the weakest link in the chain that is our\ncountry, yet we permit ourselves to comment about the federal's every practice,\nand when things aren't going the way we want, we try to ignore the rest of the\ncountry and separate, thinking that our meager economy is enough to compensate\nfor the loss of all infrastructures currently owned by the Canadian government.\nLike a teen stuck right in it's teenage crisis, we want freedom and recognition\njust for ourselves, just because some people think we can afford it, we refuse\ncooperation. The feds are ripping us off they say, taking our federal tax money\nfor the extraction of tar sands in Alberta. This is one thing that separatists\ndon't seem to understand: today, a country has to be run like a business, and I\npersonally don't know a business which would invest in something that won't\nyield, IE the province of Quebec, home of hydroelectricity and employment rates\nwell under the Canadian average.\n\nThis brings me to another point: the stubbornness of my province in relative to\ntheir culture and language. Let go of the freaking culture will you. Yes, I\nknow, our provincial motto is \"I remember\", but how about remembering and\nletting go of these stupid habits of \"protecting\" our native language by banning\neverything english we can possibly get away with. In this North American world\nof Anglos, we refuse to submit to the defacto, which would open many doors in\nprofitable sectors, and instead we let our children go through high-school\nwithout getting appropriate English language education, making them unprepared\nfor the outside world, confining them to this province they call a nation, which\nit too is being overrun with Anglo immigrants, as can testify Montreal.\n\nI just can not stand this over-patriotism that lots of people display, specially\nin this time of the year. I don't want to make myself look superior to everybody\nelse here, but it looks to me that some people just adhere to the separatist\ncrowd without even knowing what it implies, too often have I seen people my age\nnot give a shit about politics and then proudly announce that they were for the\nseparation of our oh so \"STRONG\" \"NATION\". I think that everybody needs a\nreality check: in the eternal search for a peaceful, smooth running country and\nprovince, cooperation is the key, like in pretty much everything else. Stop\ncalling Quebec a nation, it's not, never will be, or will die trying to. Don't\npeople even learn what happens when a government restructures? I haven't live\nlong enough to see lots of those, but historically, we have a good chance of\nfalling into poverty and civil war for quite a long time with such a\nrestructure.\n\nSo how about pleasing me and putting that flag down for a second, and think\nseriously about what being a nation implies. Stop blaming it all on the feds,\nit's about time that we take our responsibilities and get our act straight\nbefore we can complain. The sad truth is that Canada can continue (not without\nsome changes, but it can) without Quebec, but Quebec cannot without Canada. I am\nnot telling you to ditch all pride for your province, I love my province too,\nbut don't go overboard with it, separation is just not an option.\n\nAnd that was my political rant.

It's 2015, and I'm still not happy with the storage offerings on the market. It's better in terms of performance, and most of all it's cheaper, but I still feel we haven't made any significant breakthroughs that affect user experience, other than the ubiquitous presence of solid state drives. I think it's time to revisit of the subject of storage with a more actual perspective, seeing what works and what doesn't, and propose solutions to a problem which affects us all, that is storing the insane amount of files we manipulate every day.\\n\\nIn this first part, I'll discuss the consumer storage market in general, and how I think it could be improved. In the second part, I will discuss my approach to storing my stuff, and relate it to what I see being the future of storage.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nComputers involve incrementally, and so does storage. Moore's law sets a very aggressive pace at which computing is to evolve, and if we are to believe Intel on the matter, the law has been in effect since it was put forward. I also believe that storage has evolved at a similarly fast pace, at least quantitatively in terms of capacity and performance; drives have gotten bigger, faster, more reliable (?) and all for a price that keep's getting cheaper per gigabyte.\\n\\nWhat is disappointing however, is that if the hardware has evolved, the idea of what storage hardware has not. In the past seven years, the same metrics have been used to qualitatively assess storage. Capacity, throughput, seeks times, mean times between failure, more or less in that order, are still king. This has two effects which I believe are not contributing to a more use of ressources for the end user.\\n\\nFirst, developing things like raw capacity has resulted in products overshooting by a considerable margin the average end user's ability to use them. Browsing the average big-box store, you'd be hard pressed to find a cheap PC with less than a 2TB disk. Undoubtably, one part of the problem with this is that  the manufacturers are very keen to leverage big numbers to get boxes out of the door, and the other part is the average (unknowledgeable) consumer quickly falls into the trap of e-peen stroking at that thought that he has more 'tee-bees and gee-bees' than the next man. But realistically, who needs that much? Today, next to nobody: if there is any proof of this, it's the amount of people who are perfectly content with just a tablet (!) or who are perfectly content with new-gen computers that only have smaller SSD drives. As a power-user, I'm extremely glad for capacity to have gone up as it has, but for the average man, manufacturers are just wasting platters.\\n\\nSecond, concentrating on such metrics of performance brings nothing to the table in terms of value-added features. All the R&amp;D time spent chasing platter density and throughput is R&amp;D not spent on things which could would actually improve the end user's experience. Possibly the only exception to this is WD's Black2 drive, but to my knowledge no OEM packages this product in prebuilts, and I have never actually seen, in my many years of working retail, either interest or purchase of one of these. To be fair, my empirical evidence tells me that reliability has improved over the years, despite the inherent shortcomings of mechanical drives. But what about things like data redundancy, security and resilience?\\n\\nWith this said, the IDEA of how we should store files definitely has changed. The push for cloud hosted services for files which are traditionally the biggest, movies and music, has permeated society : videos are taken to be uploaded to social media, not to be hoarded, Netflix has killed off the Blockbusters of this world in record time, and nobody wants to go through the hassle of maintaining a large collection of files when paying a couple of bucks a month for whatever streaming service is so much more practical. In fact, most people think I'm half-retarded for maintaining so meticulously my 500gb+ iTunes library. Dropbox hosts your files, Facebook hosts your life, and then what else is there to do with a computer if not browse pictures of cats?\\n\\nBut should we really trust third parties with our data? Many things lead me to think that we shouldn't.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Way back in '08, <a href=\"http://maximerousseau.com/2008/07/21/ocn-rethinking-hard-drives-and-storage/\">I wrote an article</a> were I discussed my gripes against the computer storage offerings of the day, and my vision for what I thought would be better storage products. 2008 might aswell be a million years ago, because back then I was discussing the plummeting of cost/capacity ratio of conventional drive, and totally ignored the appearance of SSD drives (<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/03/ssds-in-2008-fast-speeds-200mbsec-over-price-cuts/\">which were astronomically expensive</a>), substituting in the discussion on smaller short-stroked drives with faster response times as a possible avenue to improve boot drive performance.

Imbues des idéaux  la démocratie devrait fonctionner, il est trop facile de voir les défauts de son incarnation pratique. On parle souvent d'un 'déficit démocratique', et si mes collègues universitaires sont généralement aussi cynique que n'importe qui, leur formation les amènent à proposer certains solutions aux problèmes de notre démocratie.\\n\\nUn des irritants communs qui fait invoquer le déficit démocratique au Canada est notre mode de scrutin. Notre pays utilise un système uninominal à un tour, aussi appelé 1MU. Dans ce système, les députés sont élus sur la base d'une seule ronde de vote où les électeurs n'ont qu'un seul vote et aucun moyen d'exprimer leur préférence de façon ordinale; le candidat avec une majorité des voix remporte la circonscription. Ceci crée certaines distortions de représentativité, puisque la relation entre la distribution des votes et la composition du parlement ont plus souvent qu'autrement aucun proportionnalité. Dans certains cas, compte tenu des marges de victoires dans les différentes circonscription, un parti peut arriver à former un gouvernement majoritaire du fait qu'il gagne la majorité absolue des sièges au parlement (ce qui lui confère un contrôle total des branches législatives et executives de notre gouvernement) malgré le fait qu'il n'a pas reçu une majorité nominale des votes. C'était le cas avec les élections de 2011, dans lesquelles les Conservateurs de M. Harper ont acquis la domination du parlement avec seulement 38% du support electoral, un chiffre encore moindre si ont considère que le population votante est une fraction de la population totale. En tout et pour tout, un pourcentage infime de la population de ce pays ont accordé le contrôle politique total au conservateurs aux dernières élections. Pour tous ceux qui n'était pas favorables aux conservateurs, ils auraient bien pu rester chez eux.\\n\\nAu Parti Libertarien du Canada, nous sommes de l'avis que l'individu est le détenteur de la souveraineté en vertu des droits naturels qui sont les siens. Nous pensons que les individus devraient être libres, et que cette liberté devrait avoir comme seules limites celles qui sont traditionnelles du droit naturel, ainsi que les engagements pris par cet individu dans le cadre d'ententes librement négociées avec d'autres personnes ou organisations. De là, il n'est pas trop difficile de dériver notre position sur la légitimité de notre gouvernement dans sa forme actuelle. Ultimement, nous voulons aussi peu de gouvernement que possible (idéalement aucun !). Cependant, si une forme de gouvernement représentatif est inévitable, sa seule source de légitimité ne peut être que la souveraineté détenue par les individus qui lui est déléguée. Dans le modèle actuel où le gouvernement ne représente pas la population et ses intérêts, nous sommes bien loins de cet idéal.\\n\\nUne solution semble s'imposer d'elle-même: changer la façon dont nous élisons nos représentants. Cette proposition fait inévitablement surface quand on mentionne le problème: si nous voulons un gouvernement représentatif, il est evident que la façon dont nous élisons nos représentants doit intégrer une composante de proportionnalité. Après avoir été mis sur la table d'innombrable fois, cette avenue semble avoir le soutien de tous sauf les grands partis qui profitent du statu quo. L'implémentation d'un mode de scrutin proportionnel n'est cependant pas sans difficulté: une fois la volonté politique derrière le projet (bonne chance!), nous devons nous assurer que la réforme respecte certains aspects de notre environnement politique. En voici quelques uns qui me concernent.\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li>Avant de s'attaquer à comment nous devons compter les votes, nous devons <strong>définir notre idéal de la démocratie et du gouvernement</strong>, et guider la réforme avec cet idéal. Nous devons nous poser de sérieuses questions qui dépassent la logistique d'une élection: est-ce que la démocratie est la somme des opinions des individus?

La première se fait sur des bases morales, prescrivant ou proscrivant certaines choses selon ce que l'on perçoit comme juste. La deuxième est aussi une justification a priori, mais avec une vision davantage conséquentialiste: on mets en place des règles dans l'espoir de produire des conséquences positives sur le fonctionnement de la société. Quand je consulte la présentation de votre projet de loi S-231, je ne vois aucune des deux justifications présenté de manière cohérente et réfléchie. Je vous écris pour manifester certaines inquiétudes et pour vous demander quelques clarifications.\\n\\nVotre prémisse de base est que les armes à feu sont la cause première des homicides. Je pourrais faire le contre-argument habituel, soit que les armes (armes à feu ou non) sont des objets inanimés dépourvus de volonté et de capacité d'action autonome. Je pourrais aussi souligner le fait que votre prémisse est philosophiquement dangereuse, car elle sous-entend la négation du libre-arbitre, réduisant les personnes à des objets propices d'être mu par la volonté malveillante de, par example, des armes à feu. Je ne présenterai pas ces contre-arguments, qui sont de nature morale; fort probablement qu'ils vous ont déjà été adressés par d'autres personnes qui croient comme moi que les individus sont fondamentalement en contrôle de leur destinée. Plutôt, je vais tenter de vaincre le feu par le feu, en adressant la partie la plus substantive de votre argumentation, soit les statistiques que vous mettez de l'avant pour justifier votre projet de loi.\\n\\nPremièrement, comme vous le savez, les homicides par armes à feu composent plus ou moins 33% des homicides commis en date de 2012 selon Statistiques Canada. Je ne doute pas que votre projet de loi s'inscrit dans une démarche holiste et cohérente pour réduire le nombre d'homicides et vaincre les crimes violents de façon globale. À la lumière de votre prémisse, qu'est-ce qui selon vous justifie la majorité accablante des homicides commis au Canada? Restant dans votre ligne de pensée, doit-on attribuer ces homicides à l'influence néfastes des armes à feu, qui auraient aussi inspirés les crimes commis avec d'autres types d'armes? Dans le cas échéant, est-ce que les autres armes utilisés pour accomplir des homicides ont aussi une volonté qui leur est propre? Que faire des meurtres commis sans armes, qui composent plus de 21% des homicides?\\n\\nDeuxièmement, j'aimerais vous entendre sur le lien que présume votre projet de loi entre la prohibition des armes à feu et leur utilisation dans les homicides. En postulant qu'un réglementation plus drastique sur certains types d'armes à feu garantira au Canadiens plus de sécurité, vous semblez penser que la réglementation a un effet sur le comportement des criminels. Je vous demanderais alors de commentez le fait que 70% des armes à feu utilisées dans des cas d'homicides entre 2003 et 2006 n'étaient pas enregistrées, donc hors de toute atteinte réglementaire. Sachant que les armes de poing sont utilisé dans seulement que la moitié des cas de meurtres non-issues des gangs criminels, je me doit aussi de critiquer le fait que vous centrez votre projet de loi sur ce type d'armes. Supposons que l'autre moitié des meurtres commis avec des armes à feu hors de scénarios de conflits reliés aux gang soit commis avec des armes à feu considéré non-restreintes (Statistiques Canada ne fourni pas un liste d'homicide par types d'armes). Serait-il déraisonnable de penser que TOUTES les armes ont un potentiel égale d'être utilisées pour commettre un crime, du ait qu'elles sont également représentées dans les statistiques? Si tel est le cas, votre acharnement sur les propriétaires d'armes restreintes est aussi injustifié statistiquement que moralement.\\n\\nFinalement, j'aimerais faire suite à une <a href=\\\"http://www.gunownersofcanada.ca/showthread.php?23296-Liberal-Senator-Introduces-Bill-to-Ban-Guns&amp;p=271148&amp;highlight=langmann#post271148\\\">réponse que vous avez fait à un autre citoyen sur la validité des études du Dr. Langmann</a>. Dans la communauté scientifique, les attaques <em>ad hominem</em> ne sont malheureusement pas des recours acceptable pour invalider les positions qui sont contraires à celles que nous aimerions défendre; vous et moi allons convenir, j'en suis certain, que ces mêmes normes doivent aussi s'appliquer aux débats politiques.

In my experience in my humanities\nprogram, Students tend to agglomerate into groups that reflect their outlier\nstatus; this is how you get things like half a dozen people coming up with\nmilitary procurement puns that only them find funny, or casual discussions of\nthe mechanics of senate reform that would assuredly make common folk (and\nprobably a large majority of Political Science students) about-turn to a more\ninteresting place. These people get dirty looks over what seems to be a heated\nargument, but is actually just a courteous debate between them. While limiting\nStudents' existence to the realm of nerdiness would be unfair as it implies\ncertain  traits, there is undeniable something nerdy in them, as far as their\nobsession over their chosen subject of study is, at the very least.\n\nAlas, due to heavy government subsidy of higher education programs and the\nsubsequent devaluation of degrees, not all university students are Students\ndeserving the capital S. Free-floating young adults who have no idea where they\nwant to be in 5 years are now heavily incentivized to continue on to higher\neducation, lured by what probably amounts to the fallacious promise of higher\nwages and  better futures, the social prestige of being \"well-educated\" and the\naura of what good things stereotypical college-life has to offer. These are the\npeople who stick to the coursework, use and abuse of the good ol' cram and puke,\nand really only attend if they have to. These are the people you get your grad\npicture taken with and have no idea they even existed. These are the people who\ngo through a 4 year degree without ever reading a book cover to cover. We'll\ncall those people Drones: they do want they need to in order to get the paper;\nforgetting that the said paper has been commodified to the point of being a slip\ncertifying attendance more than anything else.\n\nI'd argue the internet has also created two such classes of individuals. On one\nend, there is your average internet user: of no definitive age or sex, who uses\nthe internet as a means rather than an end. This person posts vapid updates to\nFacebook, instagrams meals/selfies/motivational gym quotes/cute outfits, and is\nhandy around the \"regular internet\". I would define those people as Normies (1),\nto reuse 4chan lingo.\n\nOn the other hand, you have digital natives (ie: millenials) who have a strong\npropensity to self-diagnosis of autism [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/r9k]\n(2), understand the internet's deeper nature (3), and have come to treat it for\nwhat it is, the best place for sharing whatever would be impossible to share In\nReal Life (IRL) due to numerous social stigmas. Let's call those Pepes.\nMainstream coverage of 4chan has been all over the place in it's\nmischaracterization of it's users, with descriptions such as the Internet Hate\nMachine and amalgamation with Anonymous; I don't believe that 4chan is somehow a\nlair for hate groups and anonymous hackers... using such generalizations\n\nOf course, the description I have just made is archetypical, and there is some\namount of gray between both definitions.\n\nMany times, reflecting on conversations that I had either participated in or\nheard in informal settings, I came to the conclusion as a group, we must look\ncompletely autistic to outsiders. We're obsessive-compulsive about our\ndiscipline way past the point of cringe-worthiness. What kind of neurotypical\nhuman being makes jokes on military procurement?\n\n-Memes by their nature reference knowledge.\n\n-Memes straddle the line between shitposting and\n\n-Memes are politically incorrect.\n\n-Memes are alienating to normies.\n\nSure","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2016-01-05

Back in the days where I was hard-headed and ignorant, I played only FPS's, and that this habit made me more 1337 than all my WoW playing friends, but when I started a Blood Elf Paladin on Garona on my friend's World of Warcraft account, I realized just how much of a good game this was and fell in love with it. At the time, my friend played on the official WoW servers, and like all WoW players, he spent a pretty big amount just to get his WoW fix. Just a couple of weeks after the creation of my first character, he closed down his account, under pretext that he was tired of paying for WoW. We decided to revert to our previous FPS lifestyle, but after a few weeks of not playing, it became clear that we just HAD to find some way of playing for free. And this is where my experience in WoW pirate servers begins.\\n\\nTurns out that playing WoW for free is possible, and you don't need to be specially good at anything to do it. Somehow, people have been getting some code out of blizzard and reverse engineering the hell out of the client to hack some World of Warcraft server emulators, and with time and probably lots and lots of work, some people have been able to create packages such as <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaNGOS\\\">MaNGOS</a> and <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAWE\\\">YAWE</a> available to the general public. This results in the availability of private servers being plentiful but most of the time unreliable, which makes choosing a private server pretty hard. In this guide I will not only review how to install a client for use on a private server, but I will also go through several tips and tricks on how to choose your server and my personal recommendations on the subject.\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Installing and Patching the Client</strong></p>\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">The first step to playing is of course installing the client. You have two options: either install the normal WoW client and play without all the advantages that Burning Crusade has to offer, or be smart, download for another couple of hours, and play on a TBC (The Burning Crusade) server with all the fun this implies. The BC installer can be found both on <a href=\\\"http://thepiratebay.org/search/world%20of%20warcraft%20burning%20crusade/0/3/100,200,300,400,600\\\">bittorrent</a> as well as on many mirrors, I recommend looking <a href=\\\"http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_mirrors\\\">here if you want to download by HTTP</a>. Then, it's just a matter of patching the client up to the version specified by the server you have chosen to play into. Usually, well organized servers give you the complete list of patches that you need to apply, as well as mirrors to the said patches, but on other more homebrew servers, this is not always that case. Worst case scenario, download all the patches and upgrade until you hit the correct version.</p>\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">One you have the correct client version, just change the realmlist.wtf file in the root of your World of Warcraft folder so that every URL in the file points to the pirate server you have selected. If you experience trouble connection, example if  you get repeated erronous logon messages, even if you know that your username and pass are correct, try editing the config.wtf file in the WTF folder so that the realmlist variable (\\\"SET realmlist\\\") is equal to where-ever your WoW server is at.</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"> <strong>Choosing A Server</strong></p>\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">This is the part that will most likely affect your gaming experience. It's actually quite tough to find the correct server for yourself, as there are many things to consider. First, you have to decide on what type of game you want to play: Funservers, High XP rate, or Blizzlike servers. The major difference in those types is how much time you'll be spend per level, but on some tweaked funservers, the game becomes a whole other thing. Here are a couple of facts for each type of server.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Blizzlike\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Tries to imitate as closely as possible the behavior of official, Blizzard owned servers.</li>\\n\\t<li>Provides the most realistic XP rate, so levels are spaced further apart.</li>\\n\\t<li>Most appropriate for:\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Long time WoW players.</li>\\n\\t<li>Those who want a real challenge.</li>\\n\\t<li>Roleplayers.</li>\\n\\t<li>Those with lots of time on their hands.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li>High XP Rate\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Has a higher XP rate than normal servers, ranging from 1.5 to 5 times the Blizzlike XP rate.</li>\\n\\t<li>Levels are closer, players are generally of higher level</li>\\n\\t<li>Most appropriate for:\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Occasional players who dislike spending lots of time in low level areas</li>\\n\\t<li>PVPers who do not want to wait for levels</li>\\n\\t<li>Slackers :)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n\\t<li>Funservers\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Has extreme XP rate, 10 times or more the Blizzlike rate.</li>\\n\\t<li>All players are of high level</li>\\n\\t<li>Most of the time, the game environment has been tweaked to cope with high level gain in little time, all vendors and trainers, even those of high level, are put in starting areas, for example.</li>\\n\\t<li>Lots of raids and PVP events.</li>\\n\\t<li>Level 70 can easily be achieved in less than an hour.</li>\\n\\t<li>Most appropriate for:\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>PVP matchup practices with different classes</li>\\n\\t<li>Extreme impatient people</li>\\n\\t<li>Just having some fun drooling over 3rd tier epic armor.</li>\\n\\t<li>Super uber-slackers :)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\nThere are plenty of all types of servers, although consistent and stable Blizzlike servers are a bit harder to find, so you just choose what you want. Of course, there are many other factors that will influence your final decision, such as latency, language spoken, uptime, bugginess, and amount of players online at any given time. Again, you are free to choose whatever you want.

At\nthe time, my friend played on the official WoW servers, and like all WoW\nplayers, he spent a pretty big amount just to get his WoW fix. Just a couple of\nweeks after the creation of my first character, he closed down his account,\nunder pretext that he was tired of paying for WoW. We decided to revert to our\nprevious FPS lifestyle, but after a few weeks of not playing, it became clear\nthat we just HAD to find some way of playing for free. And this is where my\nexperience in WoW pirate servers begins.\n\nTurns out that playing WoW for free is possible, and you don't need to be\nspecially good at anything to do it. Somehow, people have been getting some code\nout of blizzard and reverse engineering the hell out of the client to hack some\nWorld of Warcraft server emulators, and with time and probably lots and lots of\nwork, some people have been able to create packages such as MaNGOS\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaNGOS] and YAWE\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAWE] available to the general public. This\nresults in the availability of private servers being plentiful but most of the\ntime unreliable, which makes choosing a private server pretty hard. In this\nguide I will not only review how to install a client for use on a private\nserver, but I will also go through several tips and tricks on how to choose your\nserver and my personal recommendations on the subject.\n\nInstalling and Patching the Client\n\nThe first step to playing is of course installing the client. You have two\noptions: either install the normal WoW client and play without all the\nadvantages that Burning Crusade has to offer, or be smart, download for another\ncouple of hours, and play on a TBC (The Burning Crusade) server with all the fun\nthis implies. The BC installer can be found both on bittorrent\n[http://thepiratebay.org/search/world%20of%20warcraft%20burning%20crusade/0/3/100,200,300,400,600] \nas well as on many mirrors, I recommend looking here if you want to download by\nHTTP [http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_mirrors]. Then, it's just a matter of\npatching the client up to the version specified by the server you have chosen to\nplay into. Usually, well organized servers give you the complete list of patches\nthat you need to apply, as well as mirrors to the said patches, but on other\nmore homebrew servers, this is not always that case. Worst case scenario,\ndownload all the patches and upgrade until you hit the correct version.\n\nOne you have the correct client version, just change the realmlist.wtf file in\nthe root of your World of Warcraft folder so that every URL in the file points\nto the pirate server you have selected. If you experience trouble connection,\nexample if you get repeated erronous logon messages, even if you know that your\nusername and pass are correct, try editing the config.wtf file in the WTF folder\nso that the realmlist variable (\"SET realmlist\") is equal to where-ever your WoW\nserver is at.\n\n Choosing A Server\n\nThis is the part that will most likely affect your gaming experience. It's\nactually quite tough to find the correct server for yourself, as there are many\nthings to consider. First, you have to decide on what type of game you want to\nplay: Funservers, High XP rate, or Blizzlike servers. The major difference in\nthose types is how much time you'll be spend per level, but on some tweaked\nfunservers, the game becomes a whole other thing. Here are a couple of facts for\neach type of server.\n\n * Blizzlike * Tries to imitate as closely as possible the behavior of official,\n      Blizzard owned servers.\n    * Provides the most realistic XP rate, so levels are spaced further\n      apart.\n    * Most appropriate for: * Long time WoW players.\n       * Those who want a real challenge.\n       * Roleplayers.\n       * Those with lots of time on their hands.\n      \n      \n   \n   \n * High XP Rate * Has a higher XP rate than normal servers, ranging from 1.5 to\n      5 times the Blizzlike XP rate.\n    * Levels are closer, players are generally of higher level\n    * Most appropriate for: * Occasional players who dislike spending lots of\n         time in low level areas\n       * PVPers who do not want to wait for levels\n       * Slackers :)\n      \n      \n   \n   \n * Funservers * Has extreme XP rate, 10 times or more the Blizzlike rate.\n    * All players are of high level\n    * Most of the time, the game environment has been tweaked to cope\n      with high level gain in little time, all vendors and trainers, even those\n      of high level, are put in starting areas, for example.\n    * Lots of raids and PVP events.\n    * Level 70 can easily be achieved in less than an hour.\n    * Most appropriate for: * PVP matchup practices with different classes\n       * Extreme impatient people\n       * Just having some fun drooling over 3rd tier epic\n         armor.\n       * Super uber-slackers :)\n      \n      \n   \n   \n\nThere are plenty of all types of servers, although consistent and stable\nBlizzlike servers are a bit harder to find, so you just choose what you want. Of\ncourse, there are many other factors that will influence your final decision,\nsuch as latency, language spoken, uptime, bugginess, and amount of players\nonline at any given time. Again, you are free to choose whatever you want. Some\nmight want a somewhat buggy server, just for that fact that they can RP with\njust a couple of friends from a predefined clique, while others will prefer a\nsolid server with a rich community and extraordinary uptime for hardcore PVP.\nThere are many sites that monitor private servers to give you a list of playable\nrealms, such as Gamesites200 [http://www.gamesites200.com/wowprivate/], Gtop100\n[http://www.gtop100.com/] and WoWStatus [http://wowstatus.net/].\n\nAs for my personal favorite, it would have to be Crogges, a blizzlike TBC\nserver\nrunning 2.1.2 [http://croggesserver.com/]. We have a great community, with about\n170 people playing online at all times, we do have some lags and bugs, but our\ngreat team of experienced GMs and admins are very dedicated to flattening out\nall those wrinkles. The server is somewhere in Europe, probably somewhere close\nto Germany, and it is home to players from all countries.\n\n Registering an Account with the Server\n\nUsually, this is pretty straighforward. Many site use interfaces that have been\nconstructed for the cause, and you can just follow on-screen instructions to\nregister. Other times, the subscription is just a matter of filling out stuff on\na small form, no  email activation required, to get a working account. Since the\nWoW user systems looks like it's SQL driven, there are PLENTY of homebrews\naround.\n\nPLAY!\n\nOnce everything is properly configured, patches, realmlist, account and all, you\nmay begin exploring The World. That was easy wasn't it?

On initial planning, pretty much all the pieces are planned, ahead, and I said almost because on too many occasions, a crucial yet too often over-seen component is left out: the power supply.\\n\\nAs a special PSU-dedicated article in Computer Power User magazine informed me pretty well, often too much emphasis is put on quality components, and when it comes to what gives the juice to those quality components, there is in general a slight slacking off. You know, the parts only work as well as what powers it; a bigass hydro generator doesn't work without a river to power it.\\n\\nWith that in L1, I headed out to find the power supply. Of course, CPU presented along with it's article a couple of high and mid-ranged power supplies, but none of which really fit my needs; I wanted something over 500 watts, SLI compatible and at a price no more than 120 $CAN if possible. After a fair bit of ebaying, I finally found what was necessary to make my monster run: I present to you the Ultra X-finity 600w. In my price range, this was pretty much the best unit available. It has the following features:\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Dual 12 volt rails</li>\\n\\t<li>38 AMPs total on 12 volt rail</li>\\n\\t<li>70 % efficiency at full load</li>\\n\\t<li>Thermal cutoff, shorting, and in rush overload protection systems</li>\\n\\t<li>Meets ATX 2.2 specs</li>\\n\\t<li>Thin, flexy and sexy Forceflex cables which are more areodynamic n stuff</li>\\n\\t<li>Nvidia SLI certified</li>\\n\\t<li>100 000 hours of full load operation rating</li>\\n</ul>\\nSo yeah, its not THE ultimate power supply, but if all goes along my calculations, and even if its a bit over, I should be all right for amperage requirements of my system-to-be.

Later, after knowing that many homies from DIC used and greatly praised their EVGA components, I decided that their opinions, forged from usage and not rumor, was probably worth more. Under their encouragements, I purchased this <a href=\\\"http://evga.com/products/moreinfo.asp?pn=122-CK-NF63-TR&amp;family=20\\\">680i SE SLI motherboard</a>. Bascially, it has everything that I need: the kickass 680i chipset, high definition audio, SLI compatibility, and a very reasonable price, at under 230 $CAD shipped.\\n\\nOther than that, I also notice the support for other kickass features, such as dual RJ-45 jacks, which is supposed to reduce my ping by lots since it uses one RJ for income and one RJ for outgoing, and lots and lots of SATA ports for all my storage needs. The chipset is also passively cool with a really cool nVidia branded heatsink, with the option of adding a fan. PLUS, it fits my black and blue color scheme!!! :)\\n\\nLike all the rest of the this box, I'll have to wait the interminable two weeks for paypal and shipping.

At first I wanted the much bigger Armor full tower version, but because of price, weight and space issues, I decided that a mid-tower case was probably better for someone like me who lugs his computer around everywhere. Apart from being a very renown product, with many positive reviews like this one everywhere on the internet, it also comes from Thermaltake, an authority in everything that concerns cases and cooling. So lets take a look that this beauty.\\n\\n<strong>Packaging</strong>\\n--------------------\\nThe store from which I bought this case from shipped it in it's original box with no extra padding, so I was of course a bit worried that it could have caused some damage to my new toy. Turns out that the boxes that Thermaltake packs their cases in are pretty well built. The case's special features are all covered up (side flaps foamed and taped, side window covered in plastic), to then be placed in a cloth-like scratch resistant sleeve, another sleeve, plastic this time, then packed in foam blocks, positioned in a solid egg carton kind of material, then packed in a good old glossy cardboard box. Mine came in without even a dent in the cardboard, suggesting that with the addition padding, it could withstand even the most merciless of postal handlers.\\n\\n<strong>Box Contents</strong>\\n--------------------\\n-1 Case\\n-2 case keys\\n-1 Power button/Activity LED panel\\n-1 120mm high flow blue LED case fan (mounted on front, sucks air in)\\n-1 120mm high flow black and orange case fan (mounted on back)\\n-1 owners manual\\n-Necessary Mylar motherboard panels\\n-Key 3 case sticker\\n-A case bracket which I never found a use for\\n-Tool-less drive bay mounts\\n-Generic motherboard I/O port shield\\n-A biga*s pack of case screws, tie wraps ,and other accessories.\\n\\n<strong>Aesthetics</strong>\\n--------------------\\nThe overall case looks great. The front aluminum flaps are a very nice touch, and so are the grillings over the drive bays. The window too is awesome, with the Thermaltake engraving in the lower part, and the original cut which makes it pleasingly different from the cheaper cases which only sport a boring square window. The paint job on mine was perfect, with no irregularities anywhere, as where the logos painted on the bezel. Not a scratch to be seen in the window either.\\n\\n\\n<strong>Components</strong>\\n--------------------\\nThe frame of this case is entirely made of steel, hence very resistant, but also a tad heavier than other cases.\\n\\nThe front bezel is made out of plastic, with the little flaps being all brushed aluminum. The mesh on the drive bays and fan appear to be aluminum too, although I am no metallurgist.\\n\\nThe side window is made out of acrylic, with the vent hole made out of the same material as the front drive mesh, held with plastic pressure pegs.\\n\\n\\n<strong>Features</strong>\\n--------------------\\nThe interior of the bezel is entirely filtered by foamy filters on the drive bays, and the front 120 mm fan is filtered with a tight nylon mesh, which allows for more that reasonable airflow while still doing it's job. All the air filters are removable for easy cleaning. Anybody who has worked in an old PC knows how much dust can clog up in there, and how hot those stuffy, dusty cases get, so filtering is really a plus. Although it isn't to everyone's taste, the front bezel looks mean, and in general feels sturdy enough. However, since the front part's hinges allow the bezel to be removed entirely, there is a tiny bit of slack on the hinge side.\\n\\nAs I said before the window is very stylish and of great construction quality, and it fits flush with the edge around it, which adds to it's coolness. It can also be locked, which is useful for safely storing stuff in your case like all LAN gamers do. On the side is a vent hole which is covered by mesh, and that is a perfect fit for 92 (or 90) mm fans. I have seen some confusion on some reviews about this, but trust me, this a 92 mm slot, and not an 80 mm. For enhanced airflow and because 9 cm LED fans are incredibly hard to find, I decided to buy a 90 to 120 mm fan adaptor and mount a bigger fan in there. The slot is nicely positioned over where most motherboards mount their processors, so an additional fan will give an additional performance boost to your CPU cooler which already has LOTS of place to breath.\\n\\nThe drive bays and PCI slots are all tool-less, practical for tinkerers or for a quick swap of drives to say, lend a DVD drive to a friend. Note that the drives cannot be removed unless the front bezel is unlocked, which prevents theft at LAN parties and such.\\n\\nThe drive bay, which can hold up to four 3.5 inch hard drives, is removable, but to my disappointment is not tool-less. In the end, I guess normal people don't swap hard drives enough times per weeks to justify this.\\n\\nThis case, as many other Thermaltakes, is equipped with a small panel at the top which allows for easy access to firewire, 2x USB and audio in and out ports.

I have seen some confusion on some reviews about this, but trust me, this a 92 mm slot, and not an 80 mm. For enhanced airflow and because 9 cm LED fans are incredibly hard to find, I decided to buy a 90 to 120 mm fan adaptor and mount a bigger fan in there.

Also very neat is the onboard\ndigital display, which according to me will give the system temperature once I\nget a processor mounted in there.Check out my unboxing gallery\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/sets/72157601865522904/].\n\nAlso, since this is one of the biggest parts, I was able to start installing\nstuff in my case and optimizing the whole thing. The ever so long power supply\ncables are all now neatly folded out of sight, and I mounted a temporary CD\ndrive to get an idea of what the finished product will look like.

If it weren`t for the stupid wireless drivers...\nOtherwise, there are improvements on security, virtualization, and dev tools,\nbut non of which are really of interest (for me.).\n\nIve been using RH products all my life, from the start, and this new release has\nbut reignited the passion between me and Red Hat. Itll be interesting to see\nwhat Fr0stbyte can do running linux.\n\nGrab it here.

This sounds like a horrible ripoff when you first hear it, but just thinking about it a bit more will clarify things: soldering the 4 heatpipes to all 110 + fins would have skyrocketed the production prices, and resulted in a cooler than nobody can afford. In my opinion, we really can't blame Thermaltake for letting go on something like this. The second little fault is the quality of the base's contact surface. Us overclockers, when shopping for a cooler, look mainly for a quality base, dense and machine to perfection. Although Thermaltake's product page says the V1 has a \\\"mirror coating base\\\", what I got wasn't exactly that: the surface was a tad unequal, and milling marks were pretty clear.

The LGA775 push-pin mounts that I have used fit just like the Intel stock cooler on my motherboard, contact between base and CPU is superb. Although I can't recall the amount of sleepless nights I've spent wondering if the V1 would fit my case, I can now confirm that this cooler does fit the EVGA 680i SE SLI in a Thermaltake Armor Jr. with no interference from either the power supply up above of the abnormally high northbridge cooler right below. This cooler is a big one, so don't be thinking that you could be stuffing this in a Micro-ATX case. I would say that 85 % of mid tower can potentially house this cooler, the other deterministic factor being the position of the CPU on your motherboard, which shouldn't a problem in most cases, and even less if you have one of those almost center-mounted CPU DFI boards.

Yeah. Fortunately, the Quake 3 engine being very flexible, there is support for just about resolution you can possibly dream of. Getting it to work correctly is something else. For those who hate fixing up config files, you'll have to endure a slight bit of it: there are 3 and possibly 4 cvars to be changed in the config file.

If you used to be a server admin, you might remember creating server start shortcuts and setting some variables on the command line to force the game to load mods from the appropriate folder; well this bypass works the same way. Just add the variables above to your shortcuts in the following form: \\\"et.exe +set r_mode -1 +set r_blablabla..\\\". It's a foolproof solution, just remember to add this to ALL your shortcuts: the Xfire and Rocketdock ones included. Now that you have it running widescreen, you may notice some distortion in the far ends of your screen: mess around with the cg_fov cvar to tweak that.

With the unreal amount of patches that EA release, they could of at least thought into making 16:10 an option. Meh... Well anyways, here is how to force it to take your resolution. It's kind of like ET, only there is no configuration files to be edited, it only works with command line variables.

Not only will this liberate you from EA's annoying tendency to keep asking for a CD in hope of saving themselves from piracy, which is totally retarded because nobody uses optical drives anymore,  but it is also a mandatory part of the widescreen patching process. Because of possible legal issues, I can't give you the crack right here right now, but I can point you to Gamecopyworld, which is the best site I know for files of the kind. Look for a working crack, and don't forget to always backup your old executable and scan all shady files for viruses.

If you're like me and you use Xfire,\nyou might want to change back the game exe to NFSC.exe after you have patched\nit, anything else will not be detected by Xfire, hence no game hour logging, no\nin-game chat, etc, etc. Of course, the same process applies to Need For Speed\nUnderground 2, since the patch was originally created for that game.\n\nAlthough this isn't a big list, they are the one's that I have found up to now.\nIf you're looking for more wide screen gaming resources, check out WSGF\n[http://www.widescreengamingforum.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page], which looks\nlike THE big resource on the thing.

At first, I\nthought Vista was one of the best upgrades ever: you gotta love the redesigned\ninterface, Flip 3D, Areo and all, the new task bar with disk caching that makes\nsearching incredibly fast. Also, DirectX 10 compatibility with all the newer\ngames is a big big feature, specially for somebody like me who used to thing\nthat he was going to play all the newest games maxed out. I pertinently knew\nthat Vista would handicap performance, but I was ready to accept that (my box\nhas plenty anyways, right?) but after several frustrating experiences, I decided\nthat enough was enough: XP x64 is going back on my main system, and Vista is\ngoing to hell.\n\nFirst issue: compatibility. As if the new x64 architecture and WOW64 32 bit\nemulator issues weren't enough, Vista provides even more complications with\nsoftware compatibility. Since Vista is based on a whole new kernel which has\nstrictly nothing to do with NT 5, which was the engine for Windows 2000 and XP,\nunexplained crashes are pretty common. In this two month period, I would swear\nthat I've had more software fatal exceptions than in the past two years of my\nlife, and it's not like I've been running pre-beta software all the time. Not a\nprogram was spared: Xfire, Crysis, WoW, Quake Wars, Google Sketchup, iTunes,\nLast.fm, Folding @ Home, all of them borked a bit at some point or another, and\nmost of them are official announced as compatible with Vista. Some programs,\neither older or unsupported for a while, IE 3dMark01 SE and Aquamark, refused to\nwork at all, to my great despair. Also, some games that used to work earlier\njust stopped working altogether after a couple of weeks of normal use. WTF? I\nbought those, and I need to be able to play them whenever the heck I want to.\nVista 0, XP 1.\n\nSecondly, I realized that the performance issues it gave me weren't exactly\nworth it. Let's get it straight, most of the games that I play aren't DX10, so\njust there, appeal isn't as strong. When you add to that the fact that the\ndifference between DX9c and DX10 isn't actually mind blowing, (proof?\n[http://www.gamespot.com/features/6182140/index.html]) so the difference in my\nsituation between XP and Vista is running Crysis at medium settings under DX10,\nor running at high or with more anti aliasing with the same frame rates under\nDX9. Delta(Medium, High) > Delta(DX10,DX9). Plus, I really want to pop the 14k\n3dMarks like all the home-dawgs at OCN with the same card. According to me, the\nnVidia 8 series just wasn't ready for something like DX10, it just isn't ripe\nyet. Let's see if the 9 series and the newer G100 scheduled for this quarter\nwill change something with DX10.1.\n\nLastly, I hate how inflexible, oversimplified and idiot-proof Vista is: it seems\nthat you can't change a single system setting the OS asking you to undo it. At\nfirst , decided to keep the annoying UAC messages, mostly because I was too much\nof a lazy ass to mess around with it. When I finally took a stand and decided to\nturn it off, I got a message at every boot telling me to turn it back on, and\n\"Don't remind me again\" wasn't an option. The same security system spoiled my\nNFS:Carbon saved games and most of my installs of EA produced games after\napplying updates also won't let me access certain My Document files with certain\nprograms, even if the said program is run as administrator. Bottom line, I'm\njust tired of all the messing around.\n\nSo for all these reasons, I'm flushing Vista. It was great while it happened,\nbut I just don't think that I'm ready for such a change.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2008-01-10 22:59:08","updated_at":"2008-01-10 22:59:08","published_at":"2008-01-10 22:59:08","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e4198","uuid":"387567e7-a3d4-4a5c-9b19-0a2adbd87b03","title":"Synergy, Productivity++","slug":"synergy-productivity","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"On a computer, we power users don't just do something, we multi-task, ALL.

Don't be fooled by the term \\\"home server\\\", this isn't going to be a recycled P3 on Slot 1 in a fancy case sporting some big drives, it's gonna pack some serious punch. Hell, it might even come close to making Fr0stbyte sweat on SuperPI runs.\\n\\nThe necessity for this box came from my dad shutting down the current server \\\"Laggboxx\\\" every night. Since I don't like uploading torrents while I'm gaming for obvious reasons,  night-time is the perfect time to get cracking at making my ratios better, and a closed server doesn't seed a whole lot. I couldn't open it in the morning either, so bottom line what was supposed to be a server spent more than half the time closed. Hurray for uptime.\\n\\nThis led me to want to build myself a server. I knew that I wanted something relatively cheap, but still something that could churn out decent work units and  be quite futureproof, all while staying in the less than 700$ range, including storage drives. The key word in this whole thing was value: solid, quality used parts with good overclocking potential, and a fast yet cheap final product. After reading several build logs of such projects and/or dedicated folding boxes, I figured that my target price could yeild a pretty damn powerful machine. At the time that I wrote this article, the part's list looked like this:\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Core 2 Duo \\\"Allendale\\\" e4300, 1.8 ghz stock</li>\\n\\t<li>Mobo: DFI Blood Iron P35</li>\\n\\t<li>RAM: ???</li>\\n\\t<li>Case: Ultra Grid with 500 XVS PSU</li>\\n\\t<li>Storage\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>40 gig Western Digital on IDE, OS and applications drive</li>\\n\\t<li>250 gig Seagate 7200.10 on IDE, movies, install files, non-critical data, torrents, buffer NAS</li>\\n\\t<li>RAID 1 (mirrored) array of 2 Seagate 7200.11s on SATA, for music, media, important backups, stuff I really really want to keep.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\nAnd that's pretty much it. Why these parts? Here comes the long part.\\n\\nFirst, going with Intel was a sure thing. Not only because of fanboyism and because Intel kicks the shit out of everything else on the market, but also because I'm much more experienced at Intel overclocking, and I know a stable Intel OC when I see one. An AMD rig, even with the relatively new AM2 socket parts would have been much cheaper, but since my last AMD OC was horrible EPIC fail (I loled and wtfed at trying to lower DDR latencies, nowhere near DDR2), I decided it might be wise to shell out a bit more, get a bit more, and be more comfy with my stuff. The e2XXX series, commonly called Pentium Dual Cores, are known to be very good overclockers and generally retail for under 100$ dollars. I was looking for an<a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3505668&amp;CatId=2852\\\"> e2180</a> (1.8 ghz, 9 x 200, 1 MB L2), which I've seen many times overclocked to as far as 3.5 ghz, but then an OCN member named Kopi posted his <a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2644000&amp;CatId=2397\\\">e4300</a> (1.8 ghz, 9 x 200, 2 MB L2), which is basically the same thing with more L2, so I jumped right on it.

So as a result\nI'm 1 month in a super-stiff fiberglass cast, and the doctor who inspected me\nwanted me to stop working and biking for 8 weeks. That's two months. That's also\n2000$.\n\nConsidering the fact that I already did a deposit for my camera, that I still\nhave this month's phone bill to pay, and that I'm out of work without invalidity\ninsurance, I'm back to living off my parent's wallet again. This means two\nthings: first, my dignity has been badly shattered since I am no longer\nfinancially independent and can't do half of the things I used to do alone, and\nsecond, I'm shit poor. And when I say shit poor, I mean, SHIT POOR. Like, \"I\ncan't even pay my domain renewal which is expiring in less than half a month\"\npoor.\n\nOh, and it also means that all my projects are also either put on hold or on\nslow-mo: migrating this foru [http://condistes.org/index.php]m\n[http://condistes.org/index.php] to PHPBB3 and modding a theme for it? Not with\nonly one hand to type with. Prepping, painting and modding my Rocketfish case\nfor project Bloody Bridget\n[http://www.overclock.net/case-mod-work-logs/320953-project-bloody-bridget-rocketfish-mod.html]\n? I think not. Updating both of my blogs more often. Ha. The only thing I will\nbe doing is photography, and that's if I get to mod my cast to act as a\npseudo-tripod for holding my camera. No swimming. No biking. No showers, only\nbaths. Can somebody say gay summer?\n\nThat said, my thoughts go to everybody living with a real handicap. This little\nincident has made me think about what it would be like to live with a serious\ninjury or medical condition. I can't ride my bike for half a summer, people who\nlose an arm in a work accident can't ride at all. If I'm depressed for such a\nsmall injury, what would it be like to learn that from one day to the next,\nyou'll have to live with a severe injury and every complication that it brings?\nPeople who live as normally as they can with a physical handicap, those people\nare the true brave, and should be taken as an example. Shout out to you guys.\n\nThe last paragraph was edited because it contained badly written material which\nmay have offended some people.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2008-05-24 01:10:35","updated_at":"2008-05-24 01:10:35","published_at":"2008-05-24 01:10:35","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e41a7","uuid":"7f8b68c4-f5a1-47c9-a5b5-6374ce2c7fee","title":"[OCN] Nvidia Turning Friends Into Enemies?","slug":"ocn-nvidia-turning-friends-into-enemies","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Everybody's in the fight for GP-GPUs... and it makes me question Nvidia's ability to survive in such a market, specially when all it's CPU producing friends are openly declaring war.\\n<blockquote>Nvidia is acting weird lately.

Who the hell is going to pay over 60$ per month\nfor a basic plan here when an unlimited plan in the states it goes for 30$?\n\nThe way I'm seeing this, either Apple, Rogers, or both are trying to screw off\nwhat they consider a small market. It's about time that mobile carriers stop\ntreating us like shit and give us plans that make some sense. For people like me\nwho have been patiently waiting for a no-hacks-required iPhone in Canada, this\nis a giant ball of snot spat right to our faces.\n\nI encourage you to sign the RuinediPhone.com petition\n[http://www.ruinediphone.com/index.php] for better iPhone plans, and to spread\nthe word on your own web property.

I'm now finding myself to put more money into my chain-propelled rides than some of my buddies are spending on their gasoline guzzlers, to a point where I almost totally stopped wanting to build, rebuild, and re-rebuild my computers as a hobby in order to save up for my whips. Those two are the first two of a long series: a third bike, a scratch-build track bike this time, aka fixie, is scheduled to be started by summer of '09.\\n\\n \\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3296/2931980895_dac6a275b7.jpg?v=0\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\n\\nAfter <a href=\\\"http://maximerousseau.com/?p=60\\\">building my first computer WAYYY back</a> and trying to mod it to my tastes, I grew a taste for nice looking cases and chopping the latter up.

Sanding, chopping, painting and reassembling this huge full tower ain't a one hour thing... So that's kept me busy too. I don't know where I'm headed to with this thing, but either reselling it to cover at least cost price (which is now at about 250$, man hours not included) to buy a laptop or getting sponsors to actually put some hardware in there would be nice. Either way, I'm having tons of fun playing with brain-numbing acrylic laquer and power tools. :D <a href=\\\"http://www.overclock.net/case-mod-work-logs/320953-project-bloody-bridget-rocketfish-mod.html\\\">Check out the work log</a>!\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2936040469_185fece654.jpg?v=0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"443\\\" height=\\\"95\\\" /></p>\\n\\nWhen I'm not at school doing all of the above and/or working and studying, which is already a pretty big workload at 30 hours of school per week in addition to 20-25 hours of work, I'm constantly getting emailed by the fine folks at <a href=\\\"http://condistes.org\\\">Condistes.org</a>, a french language which I put up voluntarily for a community of campers who use specific <a href=\\\"http://www.safaricondo.com/menueng.php\\\">Westfalia-style vehicles</a>. There's always a link missing (french lanuage PHPbb + english theme = fail), a problem with one's password, spam to get taken care of, or whatever else.

I personally think that this article only recapitulates what everybody knows about open source, but hey, why not share it with the internetz? Enjoy\\n\\nFrom the very start of the emergence of computing, hundreds, thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of companies have been trying to get their share of their money to be made in the various segments of computing. The hardware sector, despite it’s explosive growth, stayed pretty simple: the giants of the industry have been fighting for market share ever since it all started, and it will continue that way. The software sector on the other hand, has been relatively the same for a very long while. From the very start of popular computing where people where buying Commodores and dot-matrix printers to type their own documents to just a couple of years ago,  people have thought there was only two ways of obtaining the software that they needed: either buying it, or obtaining it illegally, through download or sharing. People are generally unaware that for all that time, an alternative has been available: open source software.\\n\\nThose who know open source generally can’t live without it. No more shelling big bucks for basic functionality apps like word processing suites, there now is an open source equivalent or replacement to pretty much any commercial software. Some of the most popular software includes OpenOffice, the GIMP, and all the flavors of Linux, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, as sites like Sourceforge are crawling with thousands and thousands of projects.\\n\\nThe concept behind open source is simple. Put your time into the writing of a program, ask others to cooperate, then distribute the compiled software as well as the source code (actual programming code) to the world, for free. Open Source Software (AKA OSS) must not be mixed up with freeware: although all OSS is technically freeware (since it’s free), some freeware has closed source code, which makes it a whole other thing. The concept is difficult to grasp at first: why would a developer write code for free when he can do it for well over 30$ an hour? Why contribute to something and ask nothing in return? While most projects accept donations, they are clearly not making any money out of it, so how can giving away stuff be a viable alternative to today’s software sale’s system based on selling compiled code as intellectual properties? This is what this essay will explore.\\n\\nFirst of all, what makes software so popular? Obviously, first of all, it’s free. And because it’s free, it has tons of advantages attached to it, advantages that are all interlinked with one another. User-base is a very big upside: because people are free to download an app whenever they want, obviously more people are going to use the said app, hence more users are prone to liking the piece of software. From then starts word of mouth advertising, in addition to all the other kinds of user-generate publicity that OSS projects usually get. Think about the “Optimized for Firefox”, or “Get Firefox” badges you’re probably seen around the web; commercial software just doesn’t get that kind of attention, to the rare exception of some hyped, niche products like Apple’s OSX and the hardware it comes with. How often have you seen a “Get Internet Explorer” badge on the bottom of web pages? Never, and chances are you won’t live long enough to see it once either. The hype over this piece of software snowballs into something enormous (again Firefox is a prime example), and as more and more people use the piece of software, amateur or professional developers join the bandwagon, and here is another advantage: people who like your project will want to collaborate. donations, contribution to the source code, plugins, and most importantly cross-platform versions (Pidgin can run on more OS that you can name), they all become free additions to your product, which makes it even more appealing for an even larger group of people. Wash rinse, repeat, and you have yourself a project that has the potential of lasting forever.\\n\\nYes, sure, some commercial software, like Adobe Photoshop, has an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows for third party tools to be implemented, but the problem with those is that the core of the program can not be modified by the general public, so you are at the mercy of the developer for updates, security patches, and if you don’t like how the newer Photoshop looks, you can’t just ask Adobe for the source code and branch off your own project to have it your way, something that has been seen many times in OSS projects, Torrentflux/TF-B4RT and Pidgin/Carrier to names those that I am aware of. Bottom line is, with open source, you’re in control. If you don’t like what you download, you can go ahead and learn programming and make your own piece of software. <br /> \\nAnother big advantage that open source has is that very often, it’s a standard setter. Millions and millions of protocols and technologies that power the web and the apps that you use on an everyday basis are powered by open source projects: SQL (Simplified Query Language, which powers databases) is an open norm, perhaps over 90% of websites use it, and all of it’s variants are freely available. The server software that drives it, MySQL, PostGre, the web scripting that call to it, PHP, Perl, the server software that displays it, HTTPD, Tomcat, and even in some cases the website engines that run all those things together to show you the content, Wordpress, PHPBB, they all are free, open source projects. While there are some commercial alternatives to the aforementioned, they don’t fare very well, because again, a team of 50 full time coders will never, ever be able to match what thousands of collaborators can do in just a couple of hours. Had these open norms had been managed by private firms and corporations, all hell would have broken loose. Imagine the BluRay/HD-DVD type format war, but over everything: systems would be isolated from one another, confined to their own proprietary software, able to share information only with it’s similarly configured peers. Anybody who would want to break this confinement would have to pay to get to open up the specifications, possibly creating a rich cartel of software developers, constricting the growth of the entire software sector. Nobody wants that.\\n\\nSo you get the idea, open source is great. But how can it be profitable for a real world business? First, consider this fact: the home segment is a real joke to most software companies; businesses is where the real big bucks are at. So much, that many say that Microsoft could stop selling it’s OS to residential customers and still be one of the richest companies on this planet. Another example, Awil’s Avast Antivirus software is given for free to residential users to popularize the products, while enterprise licenses milk the cash cow. Take Red Hat’s example: they’ve been MAJOR contributors to the linux kernel in addition to fathering two immensely popular linux distributions: Red Hat Linux which is now defunct, and Fedora Core, later dubbed just Fedora, which is going on strong currently at it’s 9th edition. Both products are freely available, the secret to RH’s amazing revenus being their entreprise version linux, originally named Red Hat Entreprise.

I personally think that this article only recapitulates what everybody knows about open source, but hey, why not share it with the internetz? Enjoy</p>\n<p>From the very start of the emergence of computing, hundreds, thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of companies have been trying to get their share of their money to be made in the various segments of computing. The hardware sector, despite it’s explosive growth, stayed pretty simple: the giants of the industry have been fighting for market share ever since it all started, and it will continue that way. The software sector on the other hand, has been relatively the same for a very long while. From the very start of popular computing where people where buying Commodores and dot-matrix printers to type their own documents to just a couple of years ago,  people have thought there was only two ways of obtaining the software that they needed: either buying it, or obtaining it illegally, through download or sharing. People are generally unaware that for all that time, an alternative has been available: open source software.</p>\n<p>Those who know open source generally can’t live without it. No more shelling big bucks for basic functionality apps like word processing suites, there now is an open source equivalent or replacement to pretty much any commercial software. Some of the most popular software includes OpenOffice, the GIMP, and all the flavors of Linux, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, as sites like Sourceforge are crawling with thousands and thousands of projects.</p>\n<p>The concept behind open source is simple. Put your time into the writing of a program, ask others to cooperate, then distribute the compiled software as well as the source code (actual programming code) to the world, for free. Open Source Software (AKA OSS) must not be mixed up with freeware: although all OSS is technically freeware (since it’s free), some freeware has closed source code, which makes it a whole other thing. The concept is difficult to grasp at first: why would a developer write code for free when he can do it for well over 30$ an hour? Why contribute to something and ask nothing in return? While most projects accept donations, they are clearly not making any money out of it, so how can giving away stuff be a viable alternative to today’s software sale’s system based on selling compiled code as intellectual properties? This is what this essay will explore.</p>\n<p>First of all, what makes software so popular? Obviously, first of all, it’s free. And because it’s free, it has tons of advantages attached to it, advantages that are all interlinked with one another. User-base is a very big upside: because people are free to download an app whenever they want, obviously more people are going to use the said app, hence more users are prone to liking the piece of software. From then starts word of mouth advertising, in addition to all the other kinds of user-generate publicity that OSS projects usually get. Think about the “Optimized for Firefox”, or “Get Firefox” badges you’re probably seen around the web; commercial software just doesn’t get that kind of attention, to the rare exception of some hyped, niche products like Apple’s OSX and the hardware it comes with. How often have you seen a “Get Internet Explorer” badge on the bottom of web pages? Never, and chances are you won’t live long enough to see it once either. The hype over this piece of software snowballs into something enormous (again Firefox is a prime example), and as more and more people use the piece of software, amateur or professional developers join the bandwagon, and here is another advantage: people who like your project will want to collaborate. donations, contribution to the source code, plugins, and most importantly cross-platform versions (Pidgin can run on more OS that you can name), they all become free additions to your product, which makes it even more appealing for an even larger group of people. Wash rinse, repeat, and you have yourself a project that has the potential of lasting forever.</p>\n<p>Yes, sure, some commercial software, like Adobe Photoshop, has an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows for third party tools to be implemented, but the problem with those is that the core of the program can not be modified by the general public, so you are at the mercy of the developer for updates, security patches, and if you don’t like how the newer Photoshop looks, you can’t just ask Adobe for the source code and branch off your own project to have it your way, something that has been seen many times in OSS projects, Torrentflux/TF-B4RT and Pidgin/Carrier to names those that I am aware of. Bottom line is, with open source, you’re in control. If you don’t like what you download, you can go ahead and learn programming and make your own piece of software. <br /> <br>\nAnother big advantage that open source has is that very often, it’s a standard setter. Millions and millions of protocols and technologies that power the web and the apps that you use on an everyday basis are powered by open source projects: SQL (Simplified Query Language, which powers databases) is an open norm, perhaps over 90% of websites use it, and all of it’s variants are freely available. The server software that drives it, MySQL, PostGre, the web scripting that call to it, PHP, Perl, the server software that displays it, HTTPD, Tomcat, and even in some cases the website engines that run all those things together to show you the content, Wordpress, PHPBB, they all are free, open source projects. While there are some commercial alternatives to the aforementioned, they don’t fare very well, because again, a team of 50 full time coders will never, ever be able to match what thousands of collaborators can do in just a couple of hours. Had these open norms had been managed by private firms and corporations, all hell would have broken loose. Imagine the BluRay/HD-DVD type format war, but over everything: systems would be isolated from one another, confined to their own proprietary software, able to share information only with it’s similarly configured peers. Anybody who would want to break this confinement would have to pay to get to open up the specifications, possibly creating a rich cartel of software developers, constricting the growth of the entire software sector. Nobody wants that.</p>\n<p>So you get the idea, open source is great. But how can it be profitable for a real world business? First, consider this fact: the home segment is a real joke to most software companies; businesses is where the real big bucks are at. So much, that many say that Microsoft could stop selling it’s OS to residential customers and still be one of the richest companies on this planet. Another example, Awil’s Avast Antivirus software is given for free to residential users to popularize the products, while enterprise licenses milk the cash cow. Take Red Hat’s example: they’ve been MAJOR contributors to the linux kernel in addition to fathering two immensely popular linux distributions: Red Hat Linux which is now defunct, and Fedora Core, later dubbed just Fedora, which is going on strong currently at it’s 9th edition. Both products are freely available, the secret to RH’s amazing revenus being their entreprise version linux, originally named Red Hat Entreprise. By selling support and special server-centric additions to their operating system such as virtualization tools, the company has pocketed 700 million dollars in 2007, and continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Support is where it’s at, because many companies are willing to take a risk when it comes to buying software.

After some further\nreading, I discovered that the only real perk to chipset raid is the ability to\ninstall an OS on a RAID array without being needy of a dedicated controller.\nOtherwise, it's pretty much the same thing as software RAID: since there is no\ndedicated RAID chip controlling where the data flows, the CPU still have to take\ncare of all the operations concerning storage, so there are few to very little\ngains in terms of performance. Being to poor to afford a dedicated controller\nthat cost in the 200$ range\n[http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816102085], I decided to\ngo the softraid way instead.\n\nWhat I thought would be a long and tiresome process turned out to be super easy.\nLinux being super awesome, it has supported software RAID for quite a while, so\nsetting up an array with a recent distro is so easy anybody with minimal skill\nat the command line can created their own.\n\nFirst, you plug in your disks (duh), then install the actual software that\ncreates and manages your arrays, called \"mdadm\". If you're under a Red Hat based\ndistro or if you used yum for your software managing needs, just hit up the\nfollowing at the command line.\n\n> yum install mkinitrd mdadm\nAfter that, load a couple of modules:> modprobe raid1\nmodprobe linear\nmodprobe multipath\nNote that in the previous example, I only loaded a few RAID types, because I was\nonly planning on using RAID 1 anyways. Once that's done, format  and partition\nall of your new raid disks with fdisk, as explained in this tutorial\n[http://www.ehow.com/how_1000631_hard-drive-linux.html]. You'll want to use fd\nas partition type, which corresponds to Linux RAID autodetect. Once that is\ndone, all you need is two commands to create your new array.> mdadm --create\n/dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 /dev/sdd /dev/sde\nmdadm --examine --scan > /etc/mdadm.conf\nThe first command will create you array, and from then on you will have a\nvirtual disk called md0 in your /dev/ directory, which can then be mounted\nwherever you wish. The second command echo's your RAID configuration in a config\nfile, so that your RAID array is initiated on boot. The devices list above are\njust the examples I used, use whatever values fit your situation. From then on,\nthe disks will start a bit per bit sync, which according to the drive capacity\nand how powerful your machine is will take a while. You can monitor your array\nusing the command \"cat /proc/mdadm\". Once the sync is done, you can go ahead and\ndo all the regular stuff you will do with a drive, like create files system on\nit, mount it, add it to fstab for automatic mounting, and there you go, a fully\nredundant array. You may have to create a filesystem on your created array at\nsome point, which if you followed my examples and common device mounting\npractices will be mounted at /mnt/md0. Just google up the mkfs command, and\ncreate an ext3 filesystem on your device.So far, I have only run into one\nproblem, and that was self-induced. After forgetting to save the raid array's\nconfiguration in a file before rebooting, I attempted to recreate a similar\narray using /dev/sddnotation instead of /dev/sdd1. I thought I have rewritten\nall my drives while they were syncing, but turns out the only thing I messed up\nare the partition tables, and after rewriting the tables in fdisk and properly\nreconstructing my array, I had my data back. Big thanks to Google and this blog\nentry [http://blog.lostentry.org/2007/12/mdadm-devhdb1-is-too-small-0k.html] \nwhich helped me get my data back!\n\nNow that I'm running disk redundancy, I sleep better at night thinking that my 4\nyear's worth of torrenting is safe.

As\nalways the race for price/performance between Intel and AMD is on, the two\ngiants along with Nvidia are releasing new flagship products, core shrink\nremixes almost every month. That's nothing new... But other hot topics are also\nshaking up the hardware world, namely more and more parallelized computing via\nmulti-core CPUs, GP-GPUs and GPU acceleration, the growing presence of DDR3 in\nhigh performance systems, and something which I think is really special, the\nhype over smaller, cheaper, more power efficient computers, the topic of this\narticle.If you look around, you'll realized pretty much everybody is trying to\nget a stab at the new nettop/netdesk market: Via has been in the game for years\nof course, but both Intel and AMD are churning out more and more interesting\nproducts. The long awaited Atom is pretty much leading the ball, but theAthlon\n2000+\n[http://www.overclock.net/hardware-news/372854-thg-amd-athlon-2000-8w-tdp.html],\nand the upcomingBobcat\n[http://www.overclock.net/hardware-news/390103-xbitlabs-amd-bobcat-alive-despite-rumors.html]\nare also very promising alternatives. As for the actual manufacturers of such\nintegrated systems, it's pretty much a free for all.Asus\n[http://eeepc.asus.com/global/],MSI [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSI_Wind],Acer\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspire_One],HTC\n[http://www.htc.com/www/product.aspx?id=596],HP\n[http://h40059.www4.hp.com/hp2133/],Fujitsu\n[http://store.shopfujitsu.com/ca/EcomCA/buildseriesbean.do?series=U810],\neverybody wants a piece of the pie. Since I find that releasing old revamped\ntechnology is almost an insult to the thousands of engineers who have been\nworking their asses off to make better, more powerful chips, allow me to\nquestion this new hype: tiny computing has already caught on, but is it going to\nlive on? Will people really continue buying underpowered hardware just because\nit costs peanuts?\n\nI can see valid arguments on both side of the scale. I know that this isn't\nnecessarily the right place to inquire about this, but if you think about it,\nwhat applications apart from games do you use? Chances are that unless you're\ndoing some hardcore 3d modeling with SolidWorks or touching up video in\nPremiere, all you're doing is either surfing the net, writing up documents, and\nchatting on AIM or MSN. Do you really need an e8600 with 8 gigs of RAM to do\nthat? Absolutely not, and chances are that most people currently can't afford a\ncomputer won't be doing much more than that either, so all these mini laptops\nare ideal for them.\n\nI can also see those new chips working wonders in carputers, boatputers(?), and\ncomputer aided navigation/entertainment devices of all sorts. Carputers have\nbeen around for a while, but most will agree that the Atom is pretty much the\nbeefiest chip available in an integrated nano-ITX form factor which can fit\npretty much anywhere. With the rising popularity of home servers, the integrated\nAtom board is also a great choice which has a smaller physical footprint, lower\nprice and lower power consumption then theAMD Sempron powered prebuilts\n[http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?sku_id=0665000FS10098355&atab=&spviewed=&newlang=EN&logon=&langid=FR]\nI keep seeing in retail stores.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm questioning the longevity of the current low-power,\nlow-cost chips. After all, what's the point in giving lower income families\ncomputers if they are rendered obsolete only a few months after they are bought?\nThe Atom 230 has been called inapt at handling day to day computing by Tom's\n[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/Intel-Atom-Efficient,1981-18.html], which\nright off that bat is a pretty bad indication of how long the chip will survive,\nand even if it were to be good for another year or two for browsing and typing,\nthe roadmap for the Intel Atom kind of makes me want to wait. Dual core\nDiamondvilles should be landing in nettops and integrated ITX devices near you\nany time soon, and next gen Atoms code name \"Pineview\" featuring a core shrink\nto 32nm are just around the bend, ETA 2009. Normally, I'm not the type to wait\nfor a newer, better component because in the end you can just end up waiting\neternally, but in this case, buying an Atom 230 right now is pretty much stupid.\n\nCost effectiveness is also an issue. Because of the almost disposable nature of\nthe new nettops, my guess is that people will most likely want to get rid of\ntheir nettops after only a year of use (some EEE701's are already going on sale\nfor cheap on the net), which has me questioning if it's better to buy a450$ MID\n[http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834220367]and having a\nso-so user experience for a year or shelling out under900$ up front\n[http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-13?c=ca&cs=cadhs1&l=en&s=dhs]\non a REAL laptop but enjoy it's full sized keyboard, screen, and greater\nperformance for 2+ years until it becomes sluggish.\n\nPart of me just wants to empty my secondary savings account and buy a Dell Mini\n9 to run OS X on, but the other part tells me that it's a pretty stupid\ninvestment.\n\nSo, is minimal computing really the new hotness, or is it just a passing fad?

Right up until I stumbled upon Google Mobile Sync.\n\nThe concept is pretty simple: one phone, one Exchange\n[http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/2007/default.mspx] server, and all your\ncontacts and calendar entries are syncronized from whatever your smartphone is\nto the great big internetz. For the more visually inclined, have a video.\n\n\nGOOGLE HAS FREED US OF CABLES, THE ARCHAIC MEDIUMS THAT USED TO UPDATE OUR\nADDRESS BOOKS! Imagine you're on the job, Mr. X sends you a very important\nbusiness email telling you that he wants you to call back. No problem, you add\nthe dude as a contact in your GMail account (because you are using your business\nPOP3 on your GMail for superior organization of course). Then, two hours later\non the train to whatever important place, you want to call up the dude, and his\nnumber has MAGICALLY been pushed to your address book. Badabing badaboom. No\nmore messing around with awkward browsing in your Gmail contacts via 3G. You are\nfree of wires, or typing in long names like Adolph Blaine Charles David Earl Jr\nthe Second or numerous phone numbers on your iPhone's teeny tiny on-screen\nkeyboard which makes typing a 9 instead of a 0 so easy. I think that's pretty\ncool.Or consider this: you're a busy man, the manager of whatever facilities,\nlet's make it a hospital. Like any self-respecting busy man, you have a suave\nsecretary who juggles with managing your schedules, returning your phone calls,\nand typing up your stuff. With Google calendar, you can share a calendar with\nNancy, the said secretary, and have her manage all of your time, remotely, while\nnot having to place a single phone call and being updated within literally\nSECONDS (I've tested this... push is that fast). Meeting with CEO of SOandSO\nCorp over, where to? Whips out iPhone. The press conference at the Imaginary\nHotel isn't on my calendar anymore... it's been cancel. But hey, I've have a\nflight to Toronto to catch in an hour so I can help another hospital with their\nproblems relative to whatever. Oh my, even the details relative to my flight are\nmentioned on my calendar. The obvious downside is that you don't get to hear\nNancy's sensual voice every hour, but hey, it's much better than to take quick,\nhalf-assed notes in a paper agenda, isn't it?\n\nI know, MS Exchange isn't anything new. But having your very own little private\nslice of one of these for free certainly is. So for the love of god, just get\nyour sync on. It takes about 5 minutes to configure, and the most difficult\nthing for me was to clear out my Gmail contacts.\n\nI love centralizing. Long live Google.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2009-05-17 01:31:57","updated_at":"2009-05-17 01:31:57","published_at":"2009-05-17 01:31:57","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e41c1","uuid":"a1e1b144-e1bc-4645-a189-377e4932dacb","title":"Norton Tech Support Gives Away Free Product Keys!","slug":"norton-tech-support-gives-away-free-product-keys","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I was at work the other day, a lady came up wanting a preventive checkup (included in her extended warranty) and AV reinstall on her Mac.

But, leaving for the military also invovles moving out of the family home, and into the <a href=\\\"http://www.cmrsj-rmcsj.forces.gc.ca/index-eng.asp\\\">RMC St. Jean</a>. Knowing that free time is a very rare thing at St. Jean, I decided to clean up a couple of things I had laying around my room, and finalized some long overdue projects, such as my <a href=\\\"http://www.overclock.net/case-mod-work-logs/506842-project-umbra.html\\\">current case mod</a> which is getting done at a snail's pace, and a couple of routine maintenance operations on stuff on my home network.\\n\\nOne of the first things on my list was changing my home server's primary OS drive, which was previously a nearly 10 year old Western Digital Caviar 40 gig drive hooked up on IDE. It made sense to recycle the old drive way back when I was just starting to mess around with the idea of a home server, but now that the box hosts<a href=\\\"http://twitpic.com/1qjkx\\\"> 5 other network share drives</a>, I really don't want to risk some downtime or data loss because of an old drive. So I bought a new SATA WD 160 gig drive, and initially set out to copy the old drive to the new one, using Acronis TrueImage.\\n\\nDuring the copy, all went OK, but back in the system, the bootloader acted up, and with reason, because I was changing the OS from a drive recognized as /dev/hda to something more amongst the lines of /dev/sda. After numerous attempts at fixing the MBR/GRUB, I gave up, and downloaded the latest Fedora for a fresh install.\\n\\nTurns out, I really should have thought of doing that beforing even considering a full migration to a new disk. Armed with the determination to get my shit working well once and for all before I head out to St. Jean, I started installing the new OS on the fresh drive. All went well during the installation, which was pretty fast (good job working on Anaconda, Fedora people), and apart from the fact that Palimpsest detected that three of my HDs were crippled with bad sectors, including both drives in my RAID-1 array dedicated to important stuff. Woo.\\n\\nAll hard drive failure aside, it really payed off to restore a fresh OS. For one, Fedora 11 seems WAY snappier. OK, it could be due to the fact that I'm on a much faster boot disk. REgardless, with a newer version OS also comes lots of updated software goodies, including a fresh new kernel (I hadn't updated mine since F9, I'm a lazy ass). When the fresh install up and running, I set out to get my network shares going. Nothing complicated there, as my RAID1 array was automatically detected, so all there was to do was to create my mountpoints (I used <strong>/storage/whatever</strong> for all drives meant to be shared on network), edit fstab, get the SMB config running, and I was ready to go.\\n\\nNext up, <span style=\\\"text-decoration:line-through;\\\">Azureus</span> Vuze was the tricky part. I download lots of torrents... enough to have my ISP calling me on a regular basis to remind me that they have a cap thing going on (which I'll discuss in a later article). So obviously, in order to download my stuff easily and efficiently, I have a pretty complex setup when it comes to Vuze.\\n\\nMy old setup, while more complex than necessary, was pretty ghetto. I basically consisted of an installation of Vuze that was called on by rc.local on startup, that ran in command line and shot all of it's output to null. To control it, I had to used the Swing Web UI, a plugin which gives the user a complete yet simple Java powered web UI. The ports for this UI were onlocked on my router, giving me the ability to upload and manage my torrents from any computer rocking Java and an internet connection. This feature in itself was pretty nice. Downloading, completed, and .torrent files were all stored on my torrent drive, a SATA 320 gigger which I had scored for free at work, given to me by a customer who's external drive had failed and who didn't want the internal drive back. Having a dedicated torrent drive helped reduce the load on the already pretty slow OS drive which I was previously using... at some points I had so many simultaneous read/writes going on that I started getting IO errors in Vuze which automatically stopped some of my downloads... not a good thing. Anyways, the torrent drive was then shared via Samba, and mounted on my computer(s), so I could manage, relocation and view/open files. I also had this thing going on where a folder on my network share was monitored by Vuze for any new torrent files to be added... nice for batch uploading.\\n\\nThe setup worked fine, but it really wasn't ideal. The startup script was a huge fail, because it would run Vuze in root, which apart from the obvious security concerns was pretty lame because any files created/manipulated would be marked as owned by root. This meant that anything on my torrent drive, regardless of if all the folders had been chmoded to 777 beforehand, was listed as read only to the user that Samba used. Removing old files was therefor a pain in the ass, as I had to SSH into the server to change the permissions to whatever files I had to manipulated. In the end, I had a script called 777torrents which I ran whenever I needed to manipulated, that did a recursive chmod of all the torrent files. While all of these quicky fixes worked without a hitch, it isn't something I wanted to do again on the new install.\\n\\nSo I set out to install Vuze. On Fedora, this was pretty easy.\\n<blockquote>yum install azureus</blockquote>\\nYup, the Fedora repo still lists Vuze as Azureus... I'm not fond  of the new name anyways. Once that's done, there is some slight modification to some core Azureus files that need to get done in order to be able to run the application in text mode. Snatch the latest .jar file as well as complimentary modules <a href=\\\"http://azureus.sourceforge.net/index_CVS.php\\\">from this page</a>, dump them in your Azureus install directory, and you should be good to go. In my case, the directory in question was <strong>/usr/share/azureus/</strong>.\\n\\nAt this point, Azureus will be ready to run. Try it out, customize the options to your liking, check out the plugins for added functionalities. For what I needed, I downloaded the Swing Web UI, the HTML Web UI, mod for the latter plugin called <a href=\\\"http://www.joeltron.com/izureus/\\\">iZureus</a> as well as the <a href=\\\"http://www.openp4p.net/\\\">P4P</a> plugin (also something I'll be discussing by next post). <strong>BE SURE YOU INSTALL THE PLUGINS WITH THE USER YOU WILL BE RUNNING AZUREUS WITH! </strong>Since configuration information and plugins are stored in the a .azureus folder in your home directory, not doing so will mean that none of your config will carry on to other users. I learned this the hard way the first time I ever messed around with Azureus. Keep in mind that to accomplish the \\\"complete solution\\\" kind of setup that I am sporting, the user using both Azureus and Samba will have to be the same.\\n\\nOnce Azureus is up and running like you want it to, close it, and <a href=\\\"http://www.azureuswiki.com/index.php/HeadlessSwingUIAtBoot\\\">go read this wiki page</a> to get the instructions on how to start your fresh new torrent client on boot. Honestly, the instructions there are pretty concise, I don't know what else to add. Just remember to edit the script to reflect your environment, user, installation directory and all.\\n\\nWhen that's done, the only thing left is to configure the shares for all of your files. Usually Samba comes with any installation of Fedora, but if something messes up or you're using another distro, you know what to do:\\n<blockquote>yum install samba</blockquote>\\n&lt;3 yum. As for the configuration of your new service, <a href=\\\"http://www.reallylinux.com/docs/sambaserver.shtml\\\">ReallyLinux has a nice tutorial</a> (old a bit, but hey) on setting up the entire thing. Don't forget to use the same user that's running the Azureus screen daemon in the \\\"Create Server Users &amp; Directories\\\" part of the process, unless you REALLY want to make setting permissions on your torrent files a pain in the ass. You might want to consider creating a hierarchised torrent folder like I did, with the following structure:\\n<blockquote>-torrents\\n---complete (completed files get moved here)\\n---downloading (incomplete files go here)\\n---.torrents (all .torrents files are stored here, even after the torrents are removed)\\n---.toadd  (this is the infamous monitored directory in which azureus looks for new .torrent files)</blockquote>\\nLast step: change the ownership of all the shares you just created to reflect whatever user you took to run Azureus and Samba. This is usually a one command thing, it will look like this:\\n<blockquote>chown -R max302 /storage/torrents</blockquote>\\nVoila. The /storage/torrents/ folder and all of it's content is now mine. I kept the default 775 permissions, but you can always enforce something more radical once the folder is your property, 770 or 700 would make sense.\\n\\nThere you have it, a super clean, automated bittorrent server. There is only ONE thing missing from this setup, and that is a method for automatically moving .torrents from my browser's download folder directly to the .toadd folder... I've thought of a cron/at job that runs a batch script which checks the contents of the folder at regular intervals, but I just don't like the idea of things running periodically.

Throughout the 5 (or more?) systems that I have built throughout my relatively short period of interest in computers, there has been one thing that I have always omitted to enable, on every single system: AHCI. <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Host_Controller_Interface\\\">Advanced Host Controller Interface</a>, as it is otherwise known, is one of the higher level layers of the SATA norm that enables better control over hard-drives connected to a SATA controller. Concretely, using AHCI enables features which are unavailable with standard IDE controllers: Native Command Queueing (NCQ), finer grained power management options, and hot-plugging.\\n\\nPower management is something that is pretty self-explanatory, and NCQ and hot-plugging are terms well known by most computing enthousiasts, but just for the heck of it, here is a short reminder on what those things do: hot-plugging allows for the instant recognition of SATA drives plugged in a running system; it kind of makes your storage supports act like USB peripherals: you plug it in, the OS recognizes it instantly. This was previously impossible with normal IDE controllers, and although hot-plugging works on SATA in IDE mode, it isn't totally automated: you still have to ask Windows (or whatever your OS) to look for it. As for Native Command Queueing, it is kind of like QoS filtering on a network, only it's for your hard drives. The feature reads ahead on it's tasks of commands, and prioritizes tasks as to minimized the distance traveled by the R/W head. It sounds kind of complicated when described with words... have a picture:\\n\\n<img class=\\\"aligncenter\\\" title=\\\"NCQ\\\" src=\\\"http://expertester.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/300px-ncq_svg1.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"212\\\" />It might not seem like much... but in a mass-multi-tasking scenario with very full disks, you can obviously see the need for this kind of technology.\\n\\nLooks good eh? I've got bad news though: enabling AHCI in your BIOS will results in a <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsod\\\">BSOD</a> on boot. Since AHCI is something entirely different from IDE, Windows does not normally have the AHCI drivers loaded, hence why your disks are unreadable. Normally, under Windows XP, one would have to reinstall the OS in order to get AHCI working, however, Windows Vista and 7 have \\\"native\\\" support for AHCI and therefor can be set to use and AHCI storage system even after the OS has been installed. I myself have had difficulty finding out how to install the proper drivers, until I reinstalled Vista on my main box recently, where I realized that I was probably missing out on some pretty good stuff. Better late then never, I learnt how to do it, and thought I might share.\\n\\nWhat needs to be done is that the AHCI driver has to be enabled at boot, as for the OS to load properly. This can be done by enabling the generic Microsoft provided AHCI driver. All this requires is a little one key registry tweak, <a href=\\\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922976\\\">as detail in this KB article</a>. Simply changes this key:\\n\\n<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Msahci</strong>\\n\\nSo that it is equal to 0. Mine was equal to something like 4 originally. If I had to take a guess as to the nature of this number, I'd probably say that it has something to do with the driver load priority, where anything tagged 0 is loaded first, 3 last, and 4 disabled.\\n\\nAnyways, once that's done, you may reboot your computer, go into the BIOS and set SATA MODE to AHCI. Your computer SHOULD boot fine, it may take a while to startup though. Once you are booted to your desktop, the \\\"Found new hardware\\\" dialog will go tits up, and pop up 6+ new pieces of hardware: each one of the SATA ports, the AHCI controller, as well as all the devices that you have hooked up on SATA. In my case, recognizing all this hardware took about 5 minutes.\\n\\nOnce that's done, you'll have to install a driver more specific to your motherboard, as the vanilla driver is far from optimal. Get the driver from your manufacturer's web site, install the sucker, then reboot.\\n\\nOnce that's done, you'll have to go through the process of waiting for the hardware detection wizard to do it's thing.

When it's not\nfeeding me some music through earphones, it's in my pockets at all times, ready\nfor duty.\n\nThat being said, it's only natural of me to bring it along when I go running\n(and trust me I've been doing an aweful lot of that lately\n[http://www.forces.ca/]). It used to be only to play some music, but about a\nmonth ago I found an app that wonderfully compliments my jogs: Runkeeper\n[http://runkeeper.com/]. The concept is pretty simple, and it's been done before\nnumerous times: the app is basically a tracker that records your position at\nregular intervals using the iPhone's built in GPS, then compiles your distance\ntraveled, average speed, max speed, and a couple of other stats. What makes\nRunkeeper different is the really nice web-based backend that allows for much\nmore thorough processing of your record runs to extract more significant data\nand giving you the option of posting your runs/hikes/rides onto Facebook or \nTwitter [http://twitter.com/max302/status/4510833933] to inspire your friends to\nget running as well.\n\nWhile other apps only calculate distance, time, and speed without giving you any\nadditional info, Runkeeper actually takes that data and gives you all the web2.0\ngoodies, like embeddable maps, all sorts of crazy charts for stuff like vertical\nascent/descent per km, a speed/time bar graph, and even a calorie counter, for\nwhomever that may interest. It's more than a dumb bike/run computer, it's a\ncomplete fitness journal that acts as other training guidelines and motivator.\nPlus the best part is that it's free, although there is a premium version that\nisn't ad supposted, and has even more interesting features like audio cues as\nwell as in-app training programs for those of you who are totally clueless about\nrunning. The premium version is only 10$, which is way less expensive than the \nNike+iPod [http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/] system (29$ + shoes), it's primary\ncompetition. No need for special shoes, and you don't need an iPhone 3G S, it's\ncompatible with either 3G iPhones or 3G S models.\n\nAll in all, I only have on complaint, and it's that you cannot edit all the info\navailable on the website directly from your mobile device without having to fire\nup Safari and navigating through a very phone-unfriendly site. Other than this\nminor issue which is most likely to get fixed via an update, you have no reason\nto not try Runkeeper out. The chances are that if you're a regular runner/biker,\nyou'll be getting the Pro version in no time.\n\nJust don't forget about the iPhones moisture sensors\n[http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2007/10/iphone-water-se/], and always use and\nadequate holster or a ziploc bag while running!\n\nCheck out Runkeeper here [http://runkeeper.com/], download the free version\nfrom\nthe iTunes store\n[http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=300226023&mt=8]\n!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2009-10-05 13:44:26","updated_at":"2009-10-05 13:44:26","published_at":"2009-10-05 13:44:26","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e41c9","uuid":"bbda163c-68f7-4b45-9338-9f3245e30a60","title":"Prime Time","slug":"prime-time","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I've been telling myself to drag my camera around more often when I go places, but because of the nature of where I am at, it's not always easy.

Tall, compact, narrow, I would guess that it's less forgiving on longer rides but if a minor ass-ache is the cost for feeling literally empowered on the pedals, then make me numb. I wasn't sure I'd see an improvement on the pedal feel going from an already pretty solid single speed drive train to a fixed gear, but trust me, there is a difference and it's quite massive. You press harder on the pedals, it goes forward faster, it's that easy. The new whip hauls ass, no doubt, but one thing I'll have to get used to is stopping. I realized that I don't have the tools necessary to mount my brake here in the barracks, so I'll have to go brakeless for a while, and since I don't have my <a href=\\\"http://holdfastordie.squarespace.com/\\\">foot retention thingies</a> yet, skidding to a stop isn't all that easy. \\n\\nAll in all, this truly is the ideal bike for a fixed gear noob who doesn't want to venture in a half-assed 10-speed conversion. It's really too bad that winter is coming a long quickly, I really would've liked to take it out for some longer rides to compare it to my Kona a little bit more. \\n\\nCheck out <a href=\\\"http://www.subrosabrand.com/malum-fixed/\\\">Subrosa's product page</a> for more info on the bike, and ask your local bike shop what's up if you're looking into ordering one. If a shop nearby has one in stock, do yourself a favor and take it for a spin: it's a whole different cycling experience that anybody can enjoy.\\n\\nAgain, big thanks to Laf and Ryder for making this happen! I was really blown away by Ryder's customer service... I'd never expect that kind of customer interaction from a distro, high fives all around.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=subrosa+malum+fixed&amp;w=69397115@N00&amp;z=e\\\">Check out more pics on my Flickr set</a>.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If you've been following my Twitter, you've known it for a while now: I have been craving for a fixed gear for a while now.

The interest was spawned last\nsummer when I started reading BikeSnobNYC, which led me to places like \nFyxomatosis [http://www.fyxomatosis.com/], Prolly is not Probably\n[http://prollyisnotprobably.com/], and Trackosaurus Rex\n[http://www.trackosaurusrex.com/pblog/]. I did my research, look around for\nofferings other than a Bianchi Pista, because you know, for one it's pretty\nexpensive, and second, everybody and his grandmother has one. So when Subrosa\nhinted on twitter [http://twitter.com/subrosabrand] that they had a fixed gear\nin the works, I knew that the stuff was going to be pretty interesting. More\ninformation was released about halfway into summer: MSRP was going to be\n650$USD, 800$CAD according to my highly unscientific guesstimation. I was\necstatic: a badass fixie from a highly respect BMX brand for under a grand? As\nsoon as the release to public was announced on Subrosa's website, I immediately\ninquired at my bike shop.\n\nTo make a long story short, there was a pretty important misunderstanding\nbetween my local bike shop, Laferte [http://www.lafertebicycles.ca/], and Ryder\n[http://www.ryderbmx.com/], the biggest Canadian distributor for all things BMX.\nThe price I had been quote was nearly twice the USD MSRP, so I told myself that\nI'd wait for either the price to drop, or an occasion to go get one in the US.\nIt was out of boredom that I @messaged Ryder [http://twitter.com/ryderbmx] in\norder to verify if I had been quote correctly. They promptly replied that I had\nbeen grossly misquote, and were even kind enough to work it out with Phil (the\nlocal BMX dude) in order to make my acquisition of the bike more enjoyable. That\nwas 3 weeks ago. Last Saturday, I went to Laf to pick up my latest two wheeled\ntoy.\n\n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/4044358869/]\n\nSuper-stiff, all Chromo construction, surprisingly good wheels built out off\nwhich feature deep section rims and a sealed hubset, all sprinkled with Shadow\nConspiracy branded parts.

However, I understand that it is not exactly practical for anybody to run an unaltered server OS, as there are generally quite a couple of components missing for everyday use. \\n\\nHowever, as I also quickly mentioned in a previous post, there is a way to convert your server installation to a full fledged desktop version, as detailed on <a href=\\\"http://www.win2008r2workstation.com/\\\">this website dedicated to detail how it`s done</a>. This post won't walk you through what this website showcases already rather clearly, it is rather an overview of how I got my installation up and running, and what little tweaks I applied to it in order to make it friendlier for everyday use.\\n\\nFor the non tech savvy, don't fret: the conversion takes about 30 minutes of your time for the average user with a basic understand of how Windows Works (that's what it took me including the multiple required reboots), and if your computer knowledge is minimal it might end up taking you an hour, maximum. The process is almost entirely done using Windows dialogs, so there isn't any sketchy DLL replacement or whatever to brick your new install.  \\n\\nFirst off, installation. All went smooth, just your regular run of the mill Windows install, with graphical install. I chose to install the \\\"Standard\\\" version of the OS as I wanted to be sure that additional server components wouldn't be installed on my machine, but you could also have installed \\\"Enterprise\\\" had you wanted. Here is what the install looked like on first login, without any customization whatsoever. \\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/initial.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/initial.jpg?w=300\\\" alt=\\\"initial\\\" title=\\\"initial\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"187\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-299\\\" /></a>\\n\\nPretty barebones, although you do recognize the new, HUGE, Windows 7 style taskbar buttons. From then on, it was just a matter of installing the Desktop Experience package and getting rid of all the nasty server stuff, as detailed on the guide, and I ended up with this:\\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/aero.jpg\\\"><img src=\\\"http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/aero.jpg?w=300\\\" alt=\\\"aero\\\" title=\\\"aero\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"187\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-300\\\" /></a>\\n\\nSexy. However at this point I pretty much had the stock Windows 7 interface, and as everybody knows, stock sucks. So I went right ahead and put it to my liking: I flipped the task bar up to the top <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/1414923270/\\\">as I have</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/2088061002/\\\">always done it</a>, steamlined my taskbar by enabling small icons, removing those pesky Windows icons and quicklaunch toolbar and grabbed <a href=\\\"http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper_beta/details/2067/fallen_leaf.html\\\">a cool seasonal wallpaper</a> from <a href=\\\"http://interfacelift.com/\\\">Interfacelift</a>. I also installed my trusty Rocketdock, onto which I put some custom icons for the <a href=\\\"http://pkarwowski.deviantart.com/art/Adobe-CS4-Icons-108535210\\\">Adobe software</a>, the <a href=\\\"http://u-ny.deviantart.com/art/Flickr-Uploadr-23447756\\\">Flickr Uploadr</a>, as well as both the <a href=\\\"http://madfusion15.deviantart.com/art/My-Computer-PNG-51776637\\\">My Computer</a> and <a href=\\\"http://finlayy.deviantart.com/art/Trash-Can-Replacement-117233550\\\">Trash</a> icons.

My father had already purchased the essentials of an SLR rig back in his college days somewhere in the 80's: Super Program body, which probably came bundled with the <a href=\\\"http://kmp.bdimitrov.de/lenses/zooms/medium/A35-105f3.5.html\\\">SMC A 35-105mm f3.5</a>, and a Pentax AF200T flashgun. The body is just as slim as any manual 35mm camera was back in the days, and it's very, very simple. No AF, a 5 character display, most of the action goes on at the lens. I later bought a used fixed focal pancake, an <a href=\\\"http://kmp.bdimitrov.de/lenses/primes/normal/M50f2.html\\\">SMC M 50mm f2</a> for a couple of coins and a handshake. The first time I ever used it was back in my trip to Europe, where I brought it along as a lighter, more compact and rugged substitute to my D40, with the hopes of capturing the old continent on an old-timey medium. 20+ years old but it still works like a charm. \\n\\nBut of course with film, there's more to taking a picture than just pressing the shutter release: after that comes developing and processing. That's the part that's been giving me grief. There's no such thing as instant gratification with film, it's all a waiting game. If you don't shoot an entire roll, you either waste precious frames and wind it back regardless, or wait for an occasion to shoot the remainder. Then, the lab: trust me, this isn't 1995 anymore, there is no such thing as a 1 hour photo service in today's world. I was willing to cope with the situation, because after all, I'm the sucker who sold my DSLR. But when I got charged 9$ for a CD of shitty 3MP scans + developed negatives. I knew that I couldn't do with that. So I took the matter in my own hands: I bought a <a href=\\\"http://www.plustek.com/product/7200.asp\\\">Plustek Opticfilm 7200</a>. \\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"http://www.plustek.com/in/product/images/main_pic/7200.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\n\\nI really didn't know what to expect, as most of the other types of analog to digital conversion processes I had witnessed before were always kind of sketchy and usually yielded less than perfect results, tape to mpg are a good example. I had shopped around for film scanners, and it seemed that most of the products available were either <a href=\\\"http://cgi.ebay.ca/NEW-SVP-Digital-Film-35mm-Negatives-Slides-Scanner_W0QQitemZ360216173162QQcmdZViewItemQQptZAU_Computers_Scanners?hash=item53de8e9a6a#ht_8065wt_1165\\\">way shitty</a> or way expensive. It took a while before I found out the perfect compromise. At 250$CAD, the Opticfilm 7200 is a very capable scanner which digitizes 35mm and mounted slide to up to 7200 DPI in either JPG or tiff, and produces surprisingly good results. I'll be honest, you have to have some time on your hands if you want to scan your negatives, because it's a multi-step process. But if you put in the effort for preparing the negatives and doing all the dusting work and editing in Photoshop, you will get EXCELLENT results.\\n\\nSo far, I've done only a couple of scans since I was lacking the proper stuff for cleaning up my film, but the few that I've done turned out great. A gentle swipe with a microfiber cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol, a little shot of compressed air to get rid of whatever leftovers, and you're good to scan. In a dusty environment like <a href=\\\"http://twitpic.com/ot0pt\\\">my dorm</a> (for some reason the vents here spit out dust like crazy), there is always a bit of correction work to be done in Photoshop, but it's nothing the heal tool can't take care of.

If you don't shoot an entire roll, you either\nwaste precious frames and wind it back regardless, or wait for an occasion to\nshoot the remainder. Then, the lab: trust me, this isn't 1995 anymore, there is\nno such thing as a 1 hour photo service in today's world. I was willing to cope\nwith the situation, because after all, I'm the sucker who sold my DSLR. But when\nI got charged 9$ for a CD of shitty 3MP scans + developed negatives. I knew that\nI couldn't do with that. So I took the matter in my own hands: I bought a \nPlustek Opticfilm 7200 [http://www.plustek.com/product/7200.asp].\n\n\n\nI really didn't know what to expect, as most of the other types of analog to\ndigital conversion processes I had witnessed before were always kind of sketchy\nand usually yielded less than perfect results, tape to mpg are a good example. I\nhad shopped around for film scanners, and it seemed that most of the products\navailable were either way shitty\n[http://cgi.ebay.ca/NEW-SVP-Digital-Film-35mm-Negatives-Slides-Scanner_W0QQitemZ360216173162QQcmdZViewItemQQptZAU_Computers_Scanners?hash=item53de8e9a6a#ht_8065wt_1165] \nor way expensive. It took a while before I found out the perfect compromise. At\n250$CAD, the Opticfilm 7200 is a very capable scanner which digitizes 35mm and\nmounted slide to up to 7200 DPI in either JPG or tiff, and produces surprisingly\ngood results. I'll be honest, you have to have some time on your hands if you\nwant to scan your negatives, because it's a multi-step process. But if you put\nin the effort for preparing the negatives and doing all the dusting work and\nediting in Photoshop, you will get EXCELLENT results.\n\nSo far, I've done only a couple of scans since I was lacking the proper stuff\nfor cleaning up my film, but the few that I've done turned out great. A gentle\nswipe with a microfiber cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol, a little shot of\ncompressed air to get rid of whatever leftovers, and you're good to scan. In a\ndusty environment like my dorm [http://twitpic.com/ot0pt] (for some reason the\nvents here spit out dust like crazy), there is always a bit of correction work\nto be done in Photoshop, but it's nothing the heal tool can't take care of. Here\nis what I have so far:\n\n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/4180049099/]\n\n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/4181061147/]\n\n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/4183141134/]\n\nAll the shots were taken with the 50mm f2 on some Fuji Superia 400, the film I\nshoot most regularly. Resolution is great, as you can see from the full size\njpegs available from Flickr. I could no doubt get some pretty nice big prints\nwith that, and I'm not even topping off the resolution settings on the scanner.\nI don't know if the sludgy noise is caused by my film or by the scanner, but in\nthe even that it is the film, I'd be able to print off some good looking poster\nsized prints for sure.\n\nAll in all, this Plustek scanner is a great tool, but it's only as good as the\neffort you put into making your snaps look good.\n\nI also wanted to give a short little shoutout to the people running Onhop.ca\n[http://www.onhop.ca/], the place where I bought the scanner. In addition to\nhaving the lowest CAD price anywhere for this item, they were very courteous on\nthe phone when I called to discuss a problem concerning the length of my\naddress, and the shipping was just insanely fast: 36 hours from their warehouse\nto my doorstep! They don't have much of a reputation compared to giants like\nNewegg and Tiger, but I strongly recommend checking them out if you're looking\nfor electronics and random computer doodads.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2009-12-13 23:28:24","updated_at":"2009-12-13 23:28:24","published_at":"2009-12-13 23:28:24","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e41d4","uuid":"564ae242-492a-4bea-8c1f-7a86c284a09d","title":"Plustek Opticfilm 7200 Review","slug":"plustek-opticfilm-7200-review","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I wrote up a more extensive review of my new, much beloved film scanner, a <a href=\\\"http://plustek.com/product/7200.asp\\\">Plustek Opticfilm 7200</a>, over at Epinions.

It's that easy.\n    Blackra1n should now work like a charm. At least it did for me. The baseband\n    update didn't seem to affect BR's potency, although you can now forget any\n    potential unlocking.\n\nThe latter worked for me in a Windows Vista SP2 environment with an early model\niPhone 3Gs, and while I can't confirm that it will work on all platforms with\nall devices, I don't see why it shouldn't. After all, the iTunes function which\nallows any unverified restore if the phone is a goner could very possibly be a\nplanned customer care feature. But then again, since when does Apple do stuff\nfor it's customers?\n\nThat being said, if you're not necessarily trying to get a quick fix, you might\nwant to see if the steps work with the latest version of iTunes.\n\nPinging me back in case of success would most likely be very appreciated by both\nme and the jailbreak community as a whole. Drop a comment, copy to forums (with\na link of course, net etiquette requires), pingback from your blog, whatever. As\nlong as this info can get more people jailbroken, then I'm a happy man.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2010-03-27 02:31:20","updated_at":"2010-03-27 02:31:20","published_at":"2010-03-27 02:31:20","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e41da","uuid":"2733c3c3-a41e-4d54-884d-d0ffccc4237b","title":"MTL Electro: Mary Anne Hobbs @ Blue Dog Motel","slug":"mtl-electro-mary-anne-hobbs-blue-dog-motel","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I've been listening to drum &amp; bass and electronica in general <a href=\\\"http://www.last.fm/user/max302\\\">for quite a while now</a>, but it seems that I never really encountered another person with the same love of high-tempo, bass-heavy beats that I had.

The individual who sold it to me pitched it as being an excellent camera for \\\"casual picturetaking in social events or on a day at the beach\\\" and as it turned out he was talking from firsthand experience, because the focus and aperture rings were laden with sand. Not a problem, I had a steady income from military college and about 1000$'s worth of capital sleeping as 35mm SLR bodies, so I contacted John Hermanson from <a href=\\\"http://www.zuiko.com/\\\">Camtech Photo Service</a> in New York, visibly the only vintage Olympus repairman in North America at the moment. His repair work and expertise seemed universally acclaimed on many photography-related forums and Flickr, so I figured he was my best bet. One hundred loonies and a couple of weeks later, my camera was back in tip top shape, with a new silver-oxide battery conversion and all. Props to Mr. Hermanson for his excellent work, I strongly recommend his services. \\n\\nThe ergonomics are way different than anything I've ever used before. This is light years away from even the now second-oldest camera in my collection, the fatherly pass-me-down that is my Pentax Super Program. There'll be a learning curve for sure, but learning is fun, right?\\n\\nI haven't gotten around to shooting with this new toy yet though... my unemployment, moronic budget management and the loss of my film stash just aren't allow me to set out with this vintage beauty strapped to my neck.

If you've been following me at all, through <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/max302\\\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com/max302\\\">Facebook</a>, or even <a href=\\\"http://www.last.fm/user/max302\\\">Last.fm</a>, you've probably noticed that the last year or so was pretty much a drum &amp; bass phase for me. I've probably listened to a million metric shit-tons of the stuff, so much so that I've kind of grew bored of it. Through one of my friends who I've introduced to DnB in the past, I got to know dubstep. He had brought a disk of what he labeled \\\"random party stuff\\\", and smack in the middle of that mix was <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbGjxFevqgE\\\">Rusko's remix of Big Sister's \\\"Pro Nails\\\"</a>. From then on, I let go of DnB for a while and now for the past month I've been seraching the interwebs for dubstep, one thing came to another and I come across some stuff by Intoccabile.\\n\\nStraight outta' Montreal and now a regular performer in Japanese clubs, Jean-Smaille Germeil aka Intoccible puts out what he calls \\\"Future Garage\\\" under his own label, <a href=\\\"http://www.fyutchaflex.ca/\\\">Fyutchaflex</a>. Forget dubstep, this isn't about the huge Reese bass, migrain inducing wobble and other aggressive auditive irregularities we learned to love with hardcore dubstep. While it is 2-step for the most part, the sound if much smoother, with distinctive yet groovy basslines, slightly upbeat drumming somewhat resemblant with what you get for DnB.

I ADORE\nworking with music, and I like to believe that most of the time, music is what I\nneed to be really productive. Us folks from the internet-induced OCD generation\nusually have a very short attention span and without music at the workplace I\noften find myself needing to take a break and think about the last ten actions\nI've done in order to put myself back on track. Putting my iPhone on the\nspeakers seems to solve the problem... but then this too has it's own share of\nproblems: after a couple of shifts, it seems that you always get the same songs\nover and over again, even on a 16 gig device, and syncing at home isn't always\nan option.\n\n [http://www.pulptunes.com/?page_id=8]\n\nEnter PulpTunes [http://www.pulptunes.com/]: a tool that streams your entire\niTunes library to wherever the heck you can get an internet connection. I had\nfound similar tools in the past, of course I sadly I cannot remember the name,\nbut from what I remember they were either commercial pieces of software with a\nprice tag, or available only for Mac OSX. Pulptunes has none of these\nrestrictions: it's donation-ware, and it is supported by Windows, OSX, and even\nLinux and variants.\n\nThe concept behind Pulptunes is simple. It's a standalone app that peaks into\nyour iTunes library's XML file, and hosts a neat little web player from your\ncomputer that makes all you music and playlists available; all you needs is a\nbrowser, or one of the support mobile devices (iPhone, iPad and Android as of\nnow). Because it isn't merely a plugin that integrates a web server to iTunes,\nyou can run it from any OS, regardless of if iTunes is running or even installed\nat all. This makes Pulptunes the perfect addition to your existing fileserver\nsetup: you can stream your stuff from a dedicated Linux box without any other\ncomputer being online!\n\nMy preliminary testing at work has been going awesome, it seems like a great\npiece of software. This isn't a web-app carbon-copy of iTunes, in that is does\nlack some key features, but overall it's a very nice little app, and for free,\nyou can't really justify not getting it if you really want your music on the go.\nOne thing that I really don't like all that much is how the UI displays the\nsongs in your library: you have to scroll through pages, there is no fancy AJAX\ninfi-load scroll bar that lets you navigate through your tunes smoothly. For\nthose of you who are like me and have a pretty important amount of music, this\nget's frustrating pretty quickly. Oh, and it's in Flash. Yeah, I know, that kind\nof sucks, but hey, it get's the job done.\n\nGet PulpTunes here!

Paragraph (18) proposes the addition of paragraph (2) to the Copyright Act, which contains very controversial text at section (2.3):\\n\\n<blockquote>  (2.3) It is an infringement of copyright for a person to provide, by means of the Internet or another digital network, a service that the person knows or should have known is designed primarily to enable acts of copyright infringement if an actual infringement of copyright occurs by means of the Internet or another digital network as a result of the use of that service.</blockquote>\\n\\nI am no legal expert, but according to my understanding section 2.3 would pretty much make facilitation of electronic piracy illegal. Because the proposed law is so unclear, the definition of what is a system \\\"primarily designed to enable acts of copyright\\\" would have to be decided on by a judge, but the sure thing is that this addition would open the door to a legal crusade against piracy a la RIAA/MPAA who are known to invent numbers about what actually goes on file sharing sites and BitTorrent trackers. From then on, the whole thing can just snowball into a legal free-for-all: once the industry has injected enough money in lawyers to have one case won, case-law is created, making it easier them to win in future trials. I will not go over the advantages of the many new cloud-hosting and file-sharing technologies as these are very well-known, I have to remind you that making illegal not only the act of sharing but also the systems the systems people use to infringe we are putting at risk a large part of the new web technologies that makes the web more democratic and user-powered.\\n<hr />\\n<p align='center'><strong>Draconian Enforcement of DRM</strong></p>\\n\\nParagraph 22 of C-32 also proposes a rewrite that most would consider unreasonable, through the addition of section <a href=\\\"http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4580265&amp;File=45#7\\\">(29.22)</a> concerning reproduction for private purposes. The amendment is mentioned as an addition, leading to believe that there is absolutely nothing about reproduction for private purposes in the current Canadian Copyright Act; most would think that defining personal copies as a right in the eyes of the law would be a good thing, but paragraph (1)a) within section <a href=\\\"http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4580265&amp;File=45#7\\\">(29.22)</a> quickly reveals that this addition wasn't written to benefit the average consumer. It reads as such:\\n<blockquote>\\n29.22 (1) It is not an infringement of copyright for an individual to reproduce a work or other subject-matter or any substantial part of a work or other subject-matter if\\n[...]\\n     (c) the individual, in order to make the reproduction, did not circumvent, as defined in section 41, a technological protection measure, as defined in that section, or cause one to be circumvented;\\n[...]</blockquote>\\nPut shortly, Circumventing DRM to make copies of anything would be made illegal and subject to substantial fines; yet another binding in today's world where digital devices multiply.

Unlike most of the other modifications proposed which will only affect consumers who consume digital media and want to manipulate it as they wish, <a href=\\\"http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4580265&amp;File=78#18\\\">41.25</a> will most likely affect every Canadian with an internet connection. This hasn't gotten much media coverage due to everybody focusing on the DRM control portion of the bill, but it should be taken seriously as it represents a very serious menace to Canadian net neutrality. The totality of proposed paragraph 41 is and addition to the current Copyright Act... none of it is currently in place, and that's a pretty good thing if you ask me. \\n\\nThe section provides copyright holders ways to send to copyright thefts a notice of infringement and build up a case that could eventually presented in court. Where it all goes wrong is at subsection 41.26, where the ISP, upon receiving and forwarding the infringement notice to their user, must \\\"retain records that will allow the identity of the person to whom the electronic location belongs to to be determined, and do so for six months beginning on the day on which the notice of claimed infringement is received\\\", or for one year if the clamant takes judicial proceedings in the six months following the delivery of the infringement notice (41.26(b)).\\n\\nInitial reading immediately shows an obvious violation of the Canadian people's online privacy and total disregard for net neutrality: allowing the industry to force your ISP to keep your personal information in a file for their own use is in itself outrageous. But the real damage comes when considering the logistical challenge that such a system of a registry represents for ISPs. Any provider with a dynamic IP system will be forced to manually maintain a registry that cross-references IP address, timeframe of IP occupation and customer information. If the situation is anything like it was in the US with the RIAA and MPAA sending infringement notices left right and center through hired law firms, those registries will undergo explosive growth, which will in turn create additional costs for the ISPs. As always, the customer will end up paying the bill, and Canadians who are already over-charged for their internet usage will most likely face higher rates; this is the modern equivalent of authorities exerting control over printing presses in the Renaissance. Have we forgotten that access to the internet is now well on its way to being considered a fundamental human right? I don't want to pull out the traditional speech of left-wing activists who believe that rights to pretty much anything for the advance of society should be protected by the state, but access to information, as shows the <a href=\\\"http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=ca&amp;hl=en&amp;q=cablegate\\\">Cablegate</a> affair, is one of the last standing bastions of true freedom. \\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nI wish to reiterate that I am not preaching for the status quo here, but rather a more intelligent reform that isn't oriented towards please the media magnates. I must tip my hat to several valid additions to the Copyright Act that C-32 introduces, notably the additional exceptions to fair-use which are currently in a gray zone (proposed para. 29), the legal definition of non-commercial user-generated content (<a href=\\\"http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4580265&amp;File=45#7\\\">proposed para 29.21</a>), and the legislation of broadcast recording systems (such as DVRs) for on-demand consumption of media. But sadly, all the good brought by those beneficial amendments are useless if the rest of the bill goes unchanged and the lobbies of the industry get their way. \\n\\nOn another note, I do not think that the main opposition to C-32, the artists, have a viable solution with their absurd <a href=\\\"http://technaute.cyberpresse.ca/nouvelles/201011/11/01-4341746-c-32-la-taxe-du-ipod-effectue-un-retour.php\\\">iPod tax</a> (french reading), which is just consumer oppression and control of new media expressed differently for the benefit of another group... but that's subject to a whole other post.\\n\\nFinally, I'd like to invite you to take action and let your opinion be known; the bill is in its second reading so now's the time to do so. <a href=\\\"http://openparliament.ca/politicians/tony-clement/\\\">Tony Clement</a> is the sponsor for the bill, so you might want to get your message through to him first; he has a <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/TonyClement_MP\\\">Twitter account</a> and seems pretty open to replying to messages from the population. <a href=\\\"http://canada.gc.ca/directories-repertoires/direct-eng.html\\\">Contacting your MP</a>, regardless of the party, is also a great idea.

I'd like to think that this part is just a\nmis-judgement by our MPs... but sadly it's most likely the result of the\nlobbying of an industry that just doesn't want to take the leash off it's\nproducts and content.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMaking your ISP a Snitch for the Industry\n\nFor me, the most shocking of all amendments in C-32 has to be one of the last\nones: Section (41.25)\n[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4580265&File=78#18]\n, named \"Provisions Respecting Providers of Network Services or Information\nLocation Tools\". Unlike most of the other modifications proposed which will only\naffect consumers who consume digital media and want to manipulate it as they\nwish, 41.25\n[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4580265&File=78#18] \nwill most likely affect every Canadian with an internet connection. This hasn't\ngotten much media coverage due to everybody focusing on the DRM control portion\nof the bill, but it should be taken seriously as it represents a very serious\nmenace to Canadian net neutrality. The totality of proposed paragraph 41 is and\naddition to the current Copyright Act... none of it is currently in place, and\nthat's a pretty good thing if you ask me.\n\nThe section provides copyright holders ways to send to copyright thefts a notice\nof infringement and build up a case that could eventually presented in court.\nWhere it all goes wrong is at subsection 41.26, where the ISP, upon receiving\nand forwarding the infringement notice to their user, must \"retain records that\nwill allow the identity of the person to whom the electronic location belongs to\nto be determined, and do so for six months beginning on the day on which the\nnotice of claimed infringement is received\", or for one year if the clamant\ntakes judicial proceedings in the six months following the delivery of the\ninfringement notice (41.26(b)).\n\nInitial reading immediately shows an obvious violation of the Canadian people's\nonline privacy and total disregard for net neutrality: allowing the industry to\nforce your ISP to keep your personal information in a file for their own use is\nin itself outrageous. But the real damage comes when considering the logistical\nchallenge that such a system of a registry represents for ISPs. Any provider\nwith a dynamic IP system will be forced to manually maintain a registry that\ncross-references IP address, timeframe of IP occupation and customer\ninformation. If the situation is anything like it was in the US with the RIAA\nand MPAA sending infringement notices left right and center through hired law\nfirms, those registries will undergo explosive growth, which will in turn create\nadditional costs for the ISPs. As always, the customer will end up paying the\nbill, and Canadians who are already over-charged for their internet usage will\nmost likely face higher rates; this is the modern equivalent of authorities\nexerting control over printing presses in the Renaissance. Have we forgotten\nthat access to the internet is now well on its way to being considered a\nfundamental human right? I don't want to pull out the traditional speech of\nleft-wing activists who believe that rights to pretty much anything for the\nadvance of society should be protected by the state, but access to information,\nas shows the Cablegate\n[http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&pz=1&cf=all&ned=ca&hl=en&q=cablegate] \naffair, is one of the last standing bastions of true freedom.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wish to reiterate that I am not preaching for the status quo here, but rather\na more intelligent reform that isn't oriented towards please the media magnates.\nI must tip my hat to several valid additions to the Copyright Act that C-32\nintroduces, notably the additional exceptions to fair-use which are currently in\na gray zone (proposed para. 29), the legal definition of non-commercial\nuser-generated content (proposed para 29.21\n[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4580265&File=45#7]\n), and the legislation of broadcast recording systems (such as DVRs) for\non-demand consumption of media. But sadly, all the good brought by those\nbeneficial amendments are useless if the rest of the bill goes unchanged and the\nlobbies of the industry get their way.\n\nOn another note, I do not think that the main opposition to C-32, the artists,\nhave a viable solution with their absurd iPod tax\n[http://technaute.cyberpresse.ca/nouvelles/201011/11/01-4341746-c-32-la-taxe-du-ipod-effectue-un-retour.php] \n(french reading), which is just consumer oppression and control of new media\nexpressed differently for the benefit of another group... but that's subject to\na whole other post.\n\nFinally, I'd like to invite you to take action and let your opinion be known;\nthe bill is in its second reading so now's the time to do so. Tony Clement\n[http://openparliament.ca/politicians/tony-clement/] is the sponsor for the\nbill, so you might want to get your message through to him first; he has a \nTwitter account [http://twitter.com/TonyClement_MP] and seems pretty open to\nreplying to messages from the population. Contacting your MP\n[http://canada.gc.ca/directories-repertoires/direct-eng.html], regardless of the\nparty, is also a great idea. Encourage your friends, family and coworkers who\ncare about fair copyright and free access to information to get informed on the\nsubject and to voice their opinions. The Pirate Party of Canada seems to be\nholding discussions [https://www.pirateparty.ca/get-involved/local-meetings] and \nawareness campaigns [https://www.pirateparty.ca/forum/index.php?topic=445.0] in\ndifferent localities, so you might want to shoot an email their way or post on\ntheir forums if you want to get involved in a more hands-on manner.\n\nRemember, popular implication is what it takes to make democracy work... let\nyour voice be heard!

Most blame the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which according to some is almost TOO tolerant and permissive. Stop blaming the document, it is in fact ourselves that are at fault. The Charter is something that lays down concepts, and if a conflict arises over the application over one of these concepts, a judge has to deliberate over it. The problem with the current state of things is that these issues rarely even get to court, as we immediately submit as soon as we see somebody waving the charter belligerently. \\n\\nThe latest example of this is the <a href=\\\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/faggot-lyric-disqualifies-dire-straits-hit-from-canadian-radio-play/article1868052/\\\">feud</a> between the CBSC (Canadian Broadcast Standards Council) and radio stations over the playback of a song containing alleged gay slur, Dire Straights' <em>Money for Nothing</em> (<a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwDDswGsJ60\\\">Youtube</a>). Maurais Live's interview with Mr. Ronald Cowen (14/01/2011) from the CBSC revealed that a single (yes, that's ONE, as in 1) person had brought up a complaint against the song, and that from then on the council had come to the decision that the use of the word \\\"faggot\\\", judged an inappropriate slur that discriminates homosexuals, disqualified the song for radio airing. \\n\\nOne song, a handful of \\\"faggots\\\", one complaint in a quarter century, and a song is banned from the airwaves. Again, this is a prime example of how soft we Canadians collectively are whenever somebody pulls the intolerance card. Please note that the CBSC is NOT a governmental organisation but rather an \\\"<em>independent, non-governmental organization created by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) to administer standards established by its members, Canada's private broadcasters.</em>\\\" When faced to a nonsensical complaint like this one, why is it so hard to have a spine and ignore it in the name of reason? Did the CBSC fear potential legal action?

If it was open source but I didn't need it, I had it anyways, just because I thought it was cool supporting GNU and GPL and stuff.</li>\\n</ol>\\nDespite these two reasons, several features, or lack of features, made me uninstall Gaim, stuff like the raw ugliness of the buddy list, those cheesy, old-skool, Gnome-style icons, which for reason I couldn't bare, and the lack of support for the brand new funky feature on MSN Messenger 7, \\\"personal messages\\\", that customizable sub-nickname that could display what tune you were listening to. I thought that this new feature was essential, so I ditched it, and went back to my old habits.\\n\\nThen, just under a year ago, Windows Live Messenger hit the streets, and as soon as the final version came out (I was still afraid of betas in the days), I grab myself a copy and jawdropped at the loads of new features. Simplified file sharing through sharing folders,  better support of video conversations, tweakable UI that can take any color you desire, offline messaging, and all that upon first release, I was amazed of what kind of monster Microsoft had made it's chat client into. What I didn't realize is that all this beautiful Vista inspired crap was taking seriously more system resources than previous version, which I became aware of when I bought my laptop and tried torrenting @ 2 mb/s , running <a href=\\\"http://songbirdnest.com\\\">Songbird</a>, <a href=\\\"http://getfirefox.com\\\">Firefox</a>, Messenger and <a href=\\\"http://xfire.com\\\">Xfire</a> at the same time on a meagre 512 MB of RAM.  Despite this fact, I blindly continued running the official MSNM client.\\n\\nIt is only a few days ago that I was forced to move back to GAIM again. On <a href=\\\"http://dreamincode.net\\\">Dreamincode</a>, somebody was offering a short PHP job, and one of the only ways that I could reach the employer to be was by AIM, a protocol which I had never used and planned on using. Facing this, I had two possible solutions: download yet another IM client, or go the bright way and download the client to control them all : GAIM.\\n\\nThat's when I found out that Gaim had FINALLY gotten to version 2, and because of a lawsuit with AOL were forced to change their name for <a href=\\\"http://pidgin.im/\\\">Pidgin</a>.\\n\\nI didn't know what to think about the name change. After all, it wasn't the first name change that I had seen (remember the relatively recent <a href=\\\"http://www.ethereal.com/\\\">Ethereal</a> to <a href=\\\"http://www.wireshark.org/\\\">Wireshark</a> story), and in pretty much all of the name changes, the product stayed pretty much the same.  I hoped the Gaim team had fixed my peaves in this new version, but at the same time I didn't want to learn a new IM client and take all the hassle that comes with it.\\n\\nTurns out that I am really satisfied with what Gaim has become. Version 2 still has the distinct Gaim look and feel, but major additions were added to this version.  Amongst the changes, you will find:\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Many additions to the list of  support protocols, with more of those weird ones nobody seems to know, like Groupwise, Sametime, SIMPLE and XMPP.</li>\\n\\t<li>Better integration with Windows. Back in the days of Gaim, KDE and Gnome were fully functional with Gaim, as in you could close the buddy list and still have a system tray icon notifying you that your IM was still active, a major feature that lacked in the Windows version. I was tired of closing my IM each time I closed the budy list, but now Pidgin fully integrates in the Windows system tray, with a clean icon that notifies you of your status and if you have received new messages or not. Like in Windows Live messenger, you can change your status and send IMs with a right-click on the tray icon. I was pretty happy to see this considering that it was the first release with a tray icon.</li>\\n\\t<li>Redesigned, simpler accounts window, eliminating the clutter of having 3 windows pop open when you fire up the program. Much cleaner and more efficient that way.</li>\\n\\t<li>Redesigned, tabbed preferences window, makes it easier to access settings. Although I like the new look and feel, some options have been scattered about, and more protocol specific options are available through the \\\"Accounts\\\" menu.</li>\\n\\t<li>A confirm close prompt when attempting to close a window which contains unread messages. Useful since Pidgin works with tabbed chat windows.</li>\\n\\t<li> I'm not sure if this feature was present in other versions, but 2.0 now comes standard with an open-source spell-checking engine, which supports lots and lots of languages.</li>\\n</ul>\\nAnd of course, you can still expect to see those features that you know and love, that is:\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>File transfer support for every protocol that allows it.</li>\\n\\t<li>Plug-in extensibility with open API, so that development people can easily code their own add-ins.</li>\\n\\t<li>Buddy pounces, which lets you execute an action as soon as the latter is online. Usful for creating reminders linked with certain people.</li>\\n\\t<li>Text-replacement, to correct those annoying tiny-but-imcomprehensible typos.</li>\\n\\t<li>Support for just under a gazillion protocols.</li>\\n\\t<li>Polygamy support, meaning that you can log in to many accounts of the same protocol at the same time.</li>\\n\\t<li>Takes tons less resources than your average IM client. Hrmm hrmm, WLM.</li>\\n\\t<li>Tons of pre-coded plugins for your using pleasure.</li>\\n</ul>\\nOf course, I'm not saying Pidgin is perfect, it still lacks some features that most of the default IM clients offer, like webcam support, or even voicechat support for that matter, which in today's Web 2.0 is becoming a must, but since it's open source, I'm pretty sure that code-monkeys around the globe are getting a shot at these issues as I write this. Besides, Pidgin has official been taken in as a project for the <a href=\\\"http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/SummerOfCode2007\\\">Google Summer of Code</a> event, so these features are very likely to be release somewhere this summer.\\n\\nMy final word on Pidgin: if you want multi-protocol support without running 7 IM clients, and if you want a feature-rich but resource-aware client, and if you don't mind not having voice and video (<a href=\\\"http://www.skype.com\\\">Skype</a> was made for that anyways.), go for it.\\n\\nFind it <a href=\\\"http://pidgin.im/\\\">here</a>.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Before, like all noob worthy of that appellation, back in the days where I had no friends (on the internet),  I used to live with one soul instant messaging client, that is MSN Messenger.

Of course, from age ten and later, I got a bit\nbetter at my practices and downloaded a bit of extensions and tweaks, amongst\nthose were the very famous Messenger Plus and several of the plugins available\nfor it. For Messenger versions 6 & 7, I was pretty much hooked on Messenger Plus\n[http://www.msgpluslive.net/]. Of course, sometimes I would go wild in one of my\nLinux/Open source follies, and I ended up trying several remakes of messenger\nclients, amongst which many browser-based clients like eBuddy\n[http://www.ebuddy.com/] and Meebo [http://meebo.com], and eventual, I stumbled\nupon Gaim, probably the most known cross-platform, cross-protocol,\nplugin-extensible messenger client out there. For me and at that time, it was\nwonderful for two reasons:\n\n 1. It could support numerous logins on numerous protocols, something that I\n    really found cool be really never used.\n 2. It was open source, which back in the day was an incentive by itself. If it\n    was open source but I didn't need it, I had it anyways, just because I\n    thought it was cool supporting GNU and GPL and stuff.\n\nDespite these two reasons, several features, or lack of features, made me\nuninstall Gaim, stuff like the raw ugliness of the buddy list, those cheesy,\nold-skool, Gnome-style icons, which for reason I couldn't bare, and the lack of\nsupport for the brand new funky feature on MSN Messenger 7, \"personal messages\",\nthat customizable sub-nickname that could display what tune you were listening\nto. I thought that this new feature was essential, so I ditched it, and went\nback to my old habits.Then, just under a year ago, Windows Live Messenger hit\nthe streets, and as soon as the final version came out (I was still afraid of\nbetas in the days), I grab myself a copy and jawdropped at the loads of new\nfeatures. Simplified file sharing through sharing folders, better support of\nvideo conversations, tweakable UI that can take any color you desire, offline\nmessaging, and all that upon first release, I was amazed of what kind of monster\nMicrosoft had made it's chat client into. What I didn't realize is that all this\nbeautiful Vista inspired crap was taking seriously more system resources than\nprevious version, which I became aware of when I bought my laptop and tried\ntorrenting @ 2 mb/s , running Songbird [http://songbirdnest.com], Firefox\n[http://getfirefox.com], Messenger and Xfire [http://xfire.com] at the same time\non a meagre 512 MB of RAM. Despite this fact, I blindly continued running the\nofficial MSNM client.\n\nIt is only a few days ago that I was forced to move back to GAIM again. On \nDreamincode [http://dreamincode.net], somebody was offering a short PHP job, and\none of the only ways that I could reach the employer to be was by AIM, a\nprotocol which I had never used and planned on using. Facing this, I had two\npossible solutions: download yet another IM client, or go the bright way and\ndownload the client to control them all : GAIM.\n\nThat's when I found out that Gaim had FINALLY gotten to version 2, and because\nof a lawsuit with AOL were forced to change their name for Pidgin\n[http://pidgin.im/].\n\nI didn't know what to think about the name change. After all, it wasn't the\nfirst name change that I had seen (remember the relatively recent Ethereal\n[http://www.ethereal.com/] to Wireshark [http://www.wireshark.org/] story), and\nin pretty much all of the name changes, the product stayed pretty much the same.\nI hoped the Gaim team had fixed my peaves in this new version, but at the same\ntime I didn't want to learn a new IM client and take all the hassle that comes\nwith it.\n\nTurns out that I am really satisfied with what Gaim has become. Version 2 still\nhas the distinct Gaim look and feel, but major additions were added to this\nversion. Amongst the changes, you will find:\n\n * Many additions to the list of support protocols, with more of those weird\n   ones nobody seems to know, like Groupwise, Sametime, SIMPLE and XMPP.\n * Better integration with Windows.

Sure, we can take your 300 mhz K6 and your 200 mhz Pentium 2's and make something useful out of it, but a real geek wants at least one box that has it all, style, performance... basically stuff to make LAN-party buddies drool on. Everybody is dreaming about that killer 10K$ rig with dual 8800 GTX, 8 gigs of Corsair dominator, and overclocked QX6800, but let's get real, I don't know one person under 25 that can afford such a box without having a sponsorship, that or missing out on food for a couple of months in order to gather some additional cash.\\n\\nLike everybody, I have done my share of magazine reading on the topic that is hardware, and I have concocted my evil plan to create my dream machine that will send my parent's electricity bill sky-rocketing. As opposed to those shopping follies where you get the best of everything that apppears on Tiger-Direct, I decided to make my rig an realistic one, one that I could afford without working 80 hours per week for 3 months. I opted for recent, but not top of the line products, and shopped intelligently, that is looking on ebay for everything that I could possibly get there, to end up with a rig that, no, won't beat the crap out of pro-gamer rigs, but will still last a few years while being able to run decent apps and games. Here is what I ended up with:\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Chassis:</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.thermaltakeusa.com/product/Chassis/fulltower/armor/va8000bns.asp\\\"><strong><u>Thermaltake Armor</u></strong></a>\\n</p><p align=\\\"left\\\">The Thermaltake Armor, with time, has earn a solid reputation. I great reviews all over the internet, and all of them were great, including the short praise found in InventGeeks 0 dB cooling system mod. This full tower case has solid features, like a wall of fans on the front panel, lockable side-panel,top vent, and great airflow. This case is what every case should be: no frills performance with solid looks. The excellent airflow of this case is of course the major reason for my purchase, but the slick blue LED fans and the brushed, black casing is not something I would spit on either. It even comes with an air-cooled drive rack, which is great.</p>\\n<strong>Price: </strong><em>220 $CAD</em> with shipping, from ebay\\n<strong>Subtotal:</strong> 220 $CAD\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"> <strong>Motherboard</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2984798&amp;CatId=2541\\\"><strong><u>EVGA 680i SLI ATX</u></strong></a>\\n\\nFor the mainboard, I knew that I wanted something with a good chipset and socket, for upgradability later on, so I chose an Intel 775 socket mainboard with a 680i, SLI compatible chipset. Being an incult in what concerns hardware brands, I originally wanted an Asus board, one of the only brands that I knew of at the time, but then I discovered other brands while shopping, and decided to fix my choice on an EVGA branded board. I had discovered EVGA just a few weeks before while reading a hardware magazine advertising one of their new 8800 series GPUs, and I decided that it maybe was worth the look. Since pretty much every comment I saw on big websites were positive about this board, I decided to make it part of my rig.\\n\\nChipset 680i is now considered to be one of the best chipsets on the market, if not THE best. Again, I'm no hardware expert, but many enthusiasts have been praising this chipset for it's advanced control over bus speeds, as well other features frequently found on other mainboards, like multi-level RAID support, dual-RJ networking, and of course the much praised SLI setup compatibility.\\n\\nThe Intel socket 775 is a relatively old socket, working with the P4's and D's of the previous generations, as well as the new bombshells that are the Core 2 Duo family. More about the chosen processors in the next section.\\n\\n<strong>Price: </strong>300 $CAD with tax and shipping\\n<strong> Subtotal: </strong>520 $CAD\\n\\n</p><p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Processor</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2280512&amp;Tab=2&amp;NoMapp=0\\\"><strong><u>Core 2 Duo E6600</u></strong></a>\\n</p><p align=\\\"left\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">This is the beast beyond this project. Reviews for the C2D are plentiful on the internet and in magazines, and I was one of those hardware hoes who picked up one of the reviews when they came out, and even since, the thought of owning one of these mofos made me salivate. Turns out that the new procs are way cheaper than the performances might indicate, and that those new beasts are actually affordable, unlike the FX series by AMD that cost close to one grand at time of release and that are now obsolete by Core 2 standards.</p>\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">Its got everything, Viiv, 1 khz front bus, reknown power consumption, a whopping 4 megs of L2 cache, and a 2.4 ghz of bi-core, 64 bit number-crunching power. Everybody is awestruck with this new core, it beats everything that the competition, aka AMD, can shoot at it, even the upper FX series (FX-70, ect) that run for double the price.</p>\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">It's fast, without being the fastest, but still pretty much guaranteed to stay up with the competition for a couple of years for the next couple of years. I would be buying the OEM version for added value, right from tigerdirect.</p>\\n<strong><u>Price:</u></strong> 320 $CAD with shipping and tax, OEM version\\n<strong><u>Subtotal:</u></strong> 840 $CAD\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Memory</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2354315&amp;CatId=2265\\\"><strong><u>OCZ Dual Channel Titanium Alpha</u></strong></a>\\n</p><p align=\\\"left\\\">Since the processor I put on this rig is just sick, I would like to have the RAM to match it. I'm not yet sure on what sticks to choose, partially because I'm waiting for technical advice on backwards compatibility and I haven't yet decided on the brand to use, but I'm pretty sure to go with either with OCZ, Crucial, or Corsair, or any other brand (I've been a Corsair dawg ever since I got a <a href=\\\"http://corsairmemory.com/corsair/flash_memory.html#fv\\\">Flash Voyager</a>). Basically, I'm looking for DDR2 PC8000, dual-channel if possible, in the 200 something dollar range.</p>\\n<strong><u>Price:</u></strong> 300 $CAD\\n<strong><u>Subtotal:</u></strong> 1140 $CAD\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Power Supply</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2974587&amp;CatId=1483\\\"><strong>Ultra X-Finity 600 Watt</strong> </a>\\n</p><p align=\\\"left\\\">With the rig I want to build, a good power supply is a must, since some of the stuff in there will be draining lots of juice. I figured that with my motherboard, processor and GPU, plus all the bells and whistle like fans and whatnot, 600 watts would be enough. Again, my choice on this component is not really set, but I figured that I would pick a couple models and buy whatever is going to be cheap on ebay at that precise moment.</p>\\n<strong><u>Price:</u></strong> About 100 $CAD with delivery, from ebay\\n<strong><u>Subtotal:</u></strong> 1240 $CAD\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Graphics Card</strong>\\n<strong>EVGA Geforce 8800 GTS </strong>\\n</p><p align=\\\"left\\\">Another morsel of beast to further compliment this rig, the EVGA 8800 GTS is a perfect match for what I need. Although again it is not the most kick ass unit on the market, it is amongst the most powerful, and is sure to provide some serious FPS at recent games. Comes for quite cheap on ebay, if you consider the time that this card will serve without being obselete.</p>\\n<strong><u>Price:</u></strong> 400 $CAD on ebay with delivery\\n<strong><u>Subtotal:</u></strong>1640 $CAD\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2268595&amp;CatId=139\\\"><strong>Seagate 7200.10 320 gig SATA</strong></a>\\n</p><p align=\\\"left\\\">There is no specific reason for my choice of hard drive, except for the fact that I already am a fan of Seagate products. I have already purchased a 7200.10 in IDE for an external enclosure, and I was very happy with the performance, noise and heat that the drive produced, so I decided to use the SATA version of the drive on my rig. Apart from good performance and guarantee backing, the drive also boasts incredible value, at 320 gigs for below 100 $CAD, so if the need arises, it would be very cheap to implement a RAID 0 filesystem for enhanced performance.</p>\\n<strong><u>Price:</u></strong> 150 $CAD\\n<strong><u>Subtotal:</u></strong> 1790 $ CAD\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\"><strong>Coolers</strong>\\nThermaltake <a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2603809&amp;sku=T925-1162\\\">Cyclo Clear Memory Cooler</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2844210&amp;sku=T925-2034\\\">Silent 775D CPU Cooler</a>\\n</p><p align=\\\"left\\\"> I chose Thermaltake just because I thought that having a Thermaltake only branded rig would be cool, and an advantage for a sponsorship, which I can only but dream of. The two parts are pretty self-descriptive, one memory cooler, and one CPU cooler with an eight copper heatpipe design.

Directement ou non,\nsachez que vous avez participé à cette manifestation, car l'AGE a voté avec une\nMAJORITÉ ÉCRASANTE la participation à cette manifestions, avec 90% de OUI par\nles 250 membres présents, soit un peu moins de 5% de la population étudiante\ntotale (1). Nous avons même débloqué du budget pour payer des autobus et des\npetites collations pour nos braves manifestants; tout cela a même les\ncotisations qu'on vous impose à chaque session sur vos frais d'inscription!\n\nLes médias n'ont pas manqué de couvrir l'évènement, et la phrase la plus\nrapportée est sans doute la menace qu'a fait Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, porte-parole\nde l'Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) à l'endroit du\ngouvernement Charest:\n\n> C'est le dernier avertissement à ce gouvernement avant qu'on passe à la\nprochaine étape dans les moyens de pression. S'il ne recule pas sur sa hausse\ndes frais de scolarité après la mobilisation exceptionnelle d'aujourd'hui, on va\nse diriger vers une grève générale illimitée à l'hiver.\nJuste un petit rappel en passant: une \"grève générale illimitée\", ça veut dire\nune levée de cours permanent pour tout la session, autrement dit une session, ou\ndeux, ou trois... de perdues. Donc, ce que Gabriel propose en le nom des 40 000\nétudiants qu'il représente, c'est que tout le monde cesse d'étudier le temps\nd'une session, jusqu'à ce que les demandes des assemblés étudiantes soient\nsatisfaites. Peut-être que Gabriel, étant étudiant à temps partiel (2) (moins\nque 4 cours par session) à l'université dans un programme de penseurs, ne trouve\npeut-être pas ce sacrifice trop important, mais permettez-moi de douter que ses\nmembres sont prêts a le suivre dans sa noble démarche.\n\nHeureusement que l'AGECTR n'est pas affiliée à l'ASSÉ, non? C'est mal connaitre\nles milieux syndicaux: solidarité l'oblige, fort est a parié que la FEUQ, dont\ntous les étudiants du CÉGEP sont membre via l'AGECTR, sera contrainte à\nconsidérer cette grève générale elle aussi. Si le même vote non représentatif\ns'opère, c'est un congé pour tous!\n\nL'année passée, j'ai écrit plusieurs articles concernant la représentativité\nquasi nulle des associations étudiantes de la véritable base étudiante; comment\nla poignée de soit-disent représentants s'empare de manière illégitime de nos\nvoix et se permettent d'émettre des opinions pour nous.

Paul Arcand, ministre de l'environment du gouvernement libéral, a déposé pour une première lecture en chambre le projet de loi 48, <em><a href=\\\"http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-48-39-2.html\\\">Loi concernant l'inspection environnementale des véhicules automobiles</a></em>. Baptisé projet de loi sur les \\\"minounes\\\" par les médias, le projet de loi est encore flou, voir carrément vide de modalités précises, comme l'est souvent un projet de loi a la première lecture. Ce qui se discute est un programme en deux, peut-etre trois phases: un inspection obligatoire à la revente d'un véhicule de plus de 8 ans dans un premier temps, et puis plus tard une inspection annuelle requise pour immatriculer tout véhicule plus vieux que 8 ans. À partir de là, les dispositions futures sont plutôt floues... appliquer les mêmes dispositions aux véhicules agés de 6 ans et plus, et potentiellement une inspection mécanique complète sont des hypothèses qui ont étés avancées par les médias. \\n\\nAu premier coup d'oeil, ce projet de loi est une disposition tout à fait sensée qui permettera de réduire les emissions du parc automobile Quebecois. Cepedant, en regardant le programme similaire qu'on en place les Ontariens depuis maintenant plusieurs années, et en considérant tout les cotés de la medaille, on se rend bien compte que cette loi est vouée a l'échec. \\n\\nRegardons d'abord l'example Ontarien. Depuis 1999, le program <em>Drive Clean</em> impose au propriétaires de tous les véhicules personnels non-commerciaux agées de 7 ans ou plus des <a href=\\\"http://www.ontariolicences.com/index.php/vehicles/drive-clean\\\">inspections bi-annuelles</a> qui sont obligatoires pour l'obtention de l'immatriculation. Le test en lui-même est une courte inspection visuelle, suivi d'un test sur dynamometre accompagné d'un \\\"sniff test\\\", une analyse des émissions polluantes du véhicule. Si le véhicule semble conforme et satisfait au normes d'émanation des divers polluants selon les spécifications originales du véhicule plus une marge d'usure, l'inspection est réussi. Grosso modo, le cas Ontarien est un example dans ce qui se fait a travers l'Amérique du Nord; plusieurs états américains ont un système similaire en place. \\n\\nCe type d'inspection présente plusieurs problèmes. Le premier, le plus apparent, est qu'il ratisse trop large pour retirer trop peu de véhicules pollueurs de la route; selon George Iny, de l'Association pour la protection des automobilistes, 6000$ en inspection sont requis pour retirer un seul véhicule fautif de la route (<a href=\\\"http://argent.canoe.ca/lca/affaires/quebec/archives/2011/12/20111207-140055.html#video\\\">7:40</a>). Ceci pénalise ainsi plusieurs automobilistes, la grande majorité, qui sont en règle et qui n'auront jamais à faire face à un échec. Les plus touchés seront nécessairement les moins nantis, qui aurait sans doutte bien envi de consacrer cet argent dépenser en inspection et en réparations à l'achat d'un voiture plus récente, et donc plus propre sur le plan environmental. Personne n'a envi de rouler en minoune.\\n\\nDeuxiemement, la démarche du ministre ne semble aucunement tenir compte du cout en carbon que représente la fabrication d'une automobile. Une <a href=\\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car\\\">étude suggère que certain véhicules aurait  une empreinte environnementale à la fabrication aussi sinon plus élevée que ce qu'elle générera en gazes polluants a rouler</a>. Une question se pose alors: est-il vraiment plus raisonnable de changer son véhicule plus fréquemment pour un modèle plus éconénergetique? Entre Gaston qui a le pieds lourd qui change son gros Cadillac loué aux 3 ans et Mme Bergeron qui conduit sa petite Tercel entre l'église et l'épicerie du coins depuis 1995, qui a participé le plus aux changements climatiques? Et pourtant, on sait très bien qui payera dans l'éventualité de la mise en vigeure de la loi 48.\\n\\nTroisièmement, les plus grand pollueurs ne sont pas pour autant éliminés, du fait qu'il est pratiquement impossible de pleinement inspecté tout les systemes anti-pollution du véhicule sans dépenser une fortune. Les véhicules a grande cylindrée, peut importe leur émanations de gazes a effets de serre, ont automatiquement un passe-droit: ils on été conçus pour consommer plus de carburant, et sont évalués comme tel. De plus, la tricherie a prouvé être beaucoup trop facile et largement répendu dans le program Ontarien. N'importe quel amateur de voitures avec un peu de volonté et de savoir-faire peut actuellement passer avec aise le e-test Ontarien avec AUCUN équipement antipollution sinon qu'un catalyseur (<a href=\\\"http://forums.fourtitude.com/showthread.php?5041210-Just-Passed-Smogged-In-The-NAZI-state-with-a-BT-setup\\\">dans certains cas, même sans celui-ci!</a>). Dans les véhicules plus modernes, on peut facilement retrouver 4 systèmes anti-pollution ou plus, qui sont plus souvent qu'autrement invisibles pendant une inspection rapide en dessous du capot... pensé qu'un mécanicien payé a l'heure et cherchant a rentabilisé une inspection a taux fixe prendra le temps de vérifier la présence de tout ces systèmes si le \\\"Check engine\\\" n'est pas allumer, c'est surestimé le zêle des mécaniciens. \\n\\nAutre problème: le projet de loi pue le lobbyisme.

En tant que lobbyistes, l'environnement n'est pas leur priorité: ils savent très bien que ce projet de loi sera un occasion en or, tant pour les détaillants que les garage indépendants.

Les moins nantis se verront privés de leur moyen de transport. Les amateurs d'automobile qui ont un minimum de genie contourneront sans problème l'inspection. Mme Bergeron, qui se fait deja arnaqué chaque fois qu'elle se rend au garage avec son Tercel pour faire changer son huile aura une chance de plus de se faire avoir par un bandit en chienne bleue. Pendant ce temps, le gouvernement dépensera de votre argent pour faire appliquer se programme a grand frais, et en plus de refiler une facture au consommateur.

Pourquoi ne pas adopter les habitudes des européens, et d'encourager l'achat de véhicules au diesel, un carburant généralement beaucoup plus éfficace? \\n\\nLe projet de loi 48 est à mon sens un example parfait de comment les lobbies et l'industrie peuvent se servir de sujets intouchables pour influencer la législation en leur avantage.

Une étude suggère que\ncertain véhicules aurait une empreinte environnementale à la fabrication aussi\nsinon plus élevée que ce qu'elle générera en gazes polluants a rouler\n[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car]\n. Une question se pose alors: est-il vraiment plus raisonnable de changer son\nvéhicule plus fréquemment pour un modèle plus éconénergetique? Entre Gaston qui\na le pieds lourd qui change son gros Cadillac loué aux 3 ans et Mme Bergeron qui\nconduit sa petite Tercel entre l'église et l'épicerie du coins depuis 1995, qui\na participé le plus aux changements climatiques? Et pourtant, on sait très bien\nqui payera dans l'éventualité de la mise en vigeure de la loi 48.\n\nTroisièmement, les plus grand pollueurs ne sont pas pour autant éliminés, du\nfait qu'il est pratiquement impossible de pleinement inspecté tout les systemes\nanti-pollution du véhicule sans dépenser une fortune. Les véhicules a grande\ncylindrée, peut importe leur émanations de gazes a effets de serre, ont\nautomatiquement un passe-droit: ils on été conçus pour consommer plus de\ncarburant, et sont évalués comme tel. De plus, la tricherie a prouvé être\nbeaucoup trop facile et largement répendu dans le program Ontarien. N'importe\nquel amateur de voitures avec un peu de volonté et de savoir-faire peut\nactuellement passer avec aise le e-test Ontarien avec AUCUN équipement\nantipollution sinon qu'un catalyseur (dans certains cas, même sans celui-ci!\n[http://forums.fourtitude.com/showthread.php?5041210-Just-Passed-Smogged-In-The-NAZI-state-with-a-BT-setup]\n). Dans les véhicules plus modernes, on peut facilement retrouver 4 systèmes\nanti-pollution ou plus, qui sont plus souvent qu'autrement invisibles pendant\nune inspection rapide en dessous du capot... pensé qu'un mécanicien payé a\nl'heure et cherchant a rentabilisé une inspection a taux fixe prendra le temps\nde vérifier la présence de tout ces systèmes si le \"Check engine\" n'est pas\nallumer, c'est surestimé le zêle des mécaniciens.\n\nAutre problème: le projet de loi pue le lobbyisme. Dans le cadre d'un dossier\nmonté par Argent\n[http://argent.canoe.ca/lca/affaires/quebec/archives/2011/12/20111207-140055.html#video]\n, la chaine affaire de Canoe, les représentants de l'industrie ne cachent pas\navoir mit des pressions considérables sur le gouvernement pour la mise en place\nd'une telle mesure; La Corporation des concessionnaires d'automobiles du Québec\n[https://www.lobby.gouv.qc.ca/servicespublic/consultation/AfficherSommaire.aspx?NumeroInscription=E11-LE00853] \net l'Association des recycleurs de pièces d'autos et de camions\n[https://www.lobby.gouv.qc.ca/servicespublic/consultation/AfficherSommaire.aspx?NumeroInscription=E11-LE00326] \nse sont clairement positionnés. En tant que lobbyistes, l'environnement n'est\npas leur priorité: ils savent très bien que ce projet de loi sera un occasion en\nor, tant pour les détaillants que les garage indépendants. Le ministre lui-même\na dit vouloir crée une \"étanchilité entre la personne qui inspecte et les gens\nqui vont faire les réparations\" (6:00\n[http://argent.canoe.ca/lca/affaires/quebec/archives/2011/12/20111207-140055.html#video]\n), ce qui pourrait permettre a l'organisme mandaté pour les inspections de\nmettre le couteau à la gorge du consommateur quand vient le temps d'un\ninspection.\n\nConcrètement, que seront les résultats de l'application de ce projet de loi? Les\nmoins nantis se verront privés de leur moyen de transport. Les amateurs\nd'automobile qui ont un minimum de genie contourneront sans problème\nl'inspection. Mme Bergeron, qui se fait deja arnaqué chaque fois qu'elle se rend\nau garage avec son Tercel pour faire changer son huile aura une chance de plus\nde se faire avoir par un bandit en chienne bleue. Pendant ce temps, le\ngouvernement dépensera de votre argent pour faire appliquer se programme a grand\nfrais, et en plus de refiler une facture au consommateur. C'est une triple\nsur-taxe qui a mon sens est totalement inutile et injustifié, qui affectera les\npropriétaires de plus de 1.6 millions d'automobiles.\n\nD'autre mesure moins regressistes s'offre a nous si nous voulons véritablement\ncontribuer a réduire les émmanations du parc automobile Quebecois. Les prix du\ngaz ont déja encourager les ventes de véhicules de moins grande cylindrées et\ndonc généralement moins polluants: la monté en puissance de la popularité du \npetit [http://www.chevrolet.com/cruze-compact-car/] moteur\n[http://www.hyundaicanada.com/Pages/showroom/showroom.aspx?model=Veloster] \nturbo-compressés\n[http://www.ford.ca/app/fo/en/environmental/green_vehicles/ecoboost.do?lang=fr] \nen est une preuve tangible. Dans cette optique, pourquoi ne pas abaissé la\ntaille des moteurs élligibles à une surtaxe à l'immatriculation à 3 litres\n(plutôt que 4), et stratifié de manière plus aggressive la tarification pour\npunir les vraies pollueurs, peu importe l'âge de leur véhicules? Pourquoi ne pas\nadopter les habitudes des européens, et d'encourager l'achat de véhicules au\ndiesel, un carburant généralement beaucoup plus éfficace?\n\nLe projet de loi 48 est à mon sens un example parfait de comment les lobbies et\nl'industrie peuvent se servir de sujets intouchables pour influencer la\nlégislation en leur avantage. L'environnement étant devenu un intouchable au\nQuebec au même niveau que l'identité et la culture, il faudra être doublement\nvigilant quand l'on verra des lobbies annoncer en grande pompe leur appui à un\nprojet de loi en prétendant défendre de beaux ideaux.

In his latest opus, Paul has pushed past what he and his label has been known for from 2003 to 2010, that is solid OG dubstep that has nothing to do with all the brostep noise that has become so ubiquitous. His last LP, <em>Triangulation</em>, was to me one of the last true dubstep albums, presenting deep yet unagressive basslines and a plethora of tweaked sampling over a shuffle of 2-step percussions at the usual 140 bpm. The game has changed since 2010, and it seems that Hotflush has changed with it, for the best. Not that I would say that <em>Personality</em> is a far cry from <em>Triangulation</em>... but Scuba and his label definitely seems to have turned the page on \\\"traditional\\\" dubstep and moved on to something else; <em>Adrenalin</em> and all the other EP's released in 2011 tend to prove this according to me. \\n\\nSpeaking of which, if you enjoyed the <em>Adrenalin</em> EP, you will not be disappointed with this album . \\\"Ignition Key\\\" starts off strong with frank percussion and a solid yet simple bassline over an airy backdrop of reverb'ed synths. The minimal sampled vocals is pretty much the only thing reminding you that you aren't listening to 90's techno. The tone is set: you'll be hearing a lot of techno-influenced stuff in the next hour. Underbelly follows suit with a consistent 4 to the floor stomp, weird ambient noise samples (birds and a garage door?) and jazzy percussions... again, it's isn't actually techno, but it's pretty damn close. \\\"The Hope\\\", one of my favorites, brings back that jacked house mood from from \\\"Adrenalin\\\" and makes for a sure-fire dance floor igniter. \\\"Dsy Chn\\\", \\\"July\\\" and \\\"Tulips\\\", are also all reminiscent of early techno, cheesy synth lines included. \\\"Cognitive Dissonance\\\" invokes jungly drums and silky smooth female vocals, with another healthy dose of interesting if not weird samples (I've heard a dog, a lock, and a long-travel bolt action rifle). The distortion-filled \\\"Gekko\\\" reminds one of Gesaffelstein, but with an upbeat rhythm and a definitely more \\\"happy\\\" percussion track. \\\"NE1BUTU\\\", \\\"Action\\\" and \\\"If U Want\\\" are also all heavily techno-infused, albeit with longer and more present crescendos and decrescendos that defy the general convention of very progressive, predicitive beat construction and deconstruction present in minimal-techno. Here again, there are some cheesy moments... but if you ask me, it's a very important part of the aesthetic value of the pieces. The bonus track, \\\"Flash Addict\\\", almost sounds more like 2562 than Scuba, with ever-present ringing, the synth stabs, the hushed toms and an overall mysterious feel. \\n\\nThey say that everyone is a product of their environment... Scuba certainly corroborates this by having recently moved to Berlin, seeing the omni-present amount of minimal-techno influences. People keep talking about that famed \\\"UK sound\\\", and how unique and distinctive it is. Too little is said of the \\\"German sound\\\", or rather the \\\"Germanophone sound\\\" present in all of central Europe; a simple, well-built, no-frills aesthetic that values beauty within attention to minute details. Consciously or not, it seems to me that Mr. Rose is definitely assimilating this regional characteristic, and that's all for the best.\\n\\nWith all this, where are Paul Rose and his label going now? It's pretty hard to tell considering all the confusion in genre names going on. I'd be tempted to dust off the old \\\"IDM\\\" moniker to describe Hotflush's output as whole... the label of \\\"bass music\\\" being not quite sophisticated enough to describe their latest content.

Exaggerated\nenthusiasm for \"progressivism\" (I hate that word, more on that later), the\nworship of our providence state as if it were some sort of god, the demand for\nfree this, universal that, state-monopolies here, oppressive regulation there;\nfrom what I'm getting, this is what theses protests are going for. It didn't\nwork the first time around, what makes you think that it'll work this time?\n\nSo, who is backing this up? The usual suspects, the left-leaning and nationalist\nintelligentsia. Because it's awfully convenient. In a province of emotive\nelectors and political incults, what better way to give your project some appeal\nthan backing it up with a tale of epic struggle against the evils of the\nCanadian governement and the free market? The amorphous mass, the 5 o'clock news\nwatchers, what better way to stir them into voting radically than to show them a\ntelevised revolution? This, to me, a disgusting attempt at transforming the\ninertia of legitimate popular concern into political capital of sympathy.\n\nAt first, I wrote this long, angry article about this situation, but I scrapped\nit. Because frankly, in the end, all of this agitation isn't going anywhere. The\nsocialists and nationalists are feeding the fire of protest with old junk they\nfound buried in the back yard, our constitutional failures, our pathetic\nreferendums, our angst and discomfort with our identity as North-Americans. That\nmight work for a while but eventually, they're going to choke the fire out.\nDespite our gaudy pretensions, our firm belief that we are worth better, we just\ndon't have the balls for a real social change, let alone a revolution. In the\nend, we are but backyard revolutionaries.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2012-04-20 03:49:23","updated_at":"2012-04-20 03:49:23","published_at":"2012-04-20 03:49:23","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e421e","uuid":"6c126430-6e11-41c3-945d-cac75c360feb","title":"Strikes, Boycotts and Court Orders: Torwards Dangerous Precendants","slug":"strikes-boycotts-and-court-orders-torwards-dangerous-precendants","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"In this battle against tuition rise, the students have many things going against them, and right after the government itself, the second biggest shit disturber is without a doubt the inside resistance from certain students.

As it turns out, the iPhone 5 wasn't announced, and besides iOS 6, I felt like it was mostly the new Retina display-equipped Macbook Pro that stole the show. After all, it is quite a big deal...  despite not being on par with pixel pitch on the new iPad (aka v3, I hate that stupid name) or the iPhone, the new display brings laptop display pixel pitch to a new all-time high. That's all fine and dandy... right up until you figure out that that they've compromised pretty much everything other than the screen to be able to use the Retina moniker on this new product.\\n\\nThe problem with the new Retina MacBooks is that it's Apple's cockiest products yet. <a href=\\\"http://ifixit.org/2763/the-new-macbook-pro-unfixable-unhackable-untenable/\\\">As iFixit has reported</a>, it's probably the least repair and upgrade-friendly notebook every produced, with NOTHING being easily user-upgradeable, and damn-near every component soldered right onto the motherboard. For the consumer, this means that buying AppleCare is almost mandatory, seeing as nobody wants to be the proud owner of a 2000+$ brick if anything happens after the 1 year base warranty. That in itself isn't what bothers me: Apple answered a demand for ever thinner, better laptops and in the end only the consumer can be blamed for creating a demand for such a ridiculous product. What's potentially problematic is that Apple's cocky move might just put them into a very dire situation.\\n\\nAllow me to contextualize with a little anecdote. Having been an in-store technician for a big-box retailer for most of the last 5 years, I've seen the <a href=\\\"http://forums.redflagdeals.com/merged-nvidia-gpu-class-action-settlement-affected-hp-dell-apple-laptops-947110/\\\">Nvidia laptop chipset scandal</a> unfurl firsthand. I f I have learned anything from it, it's that mass-marketing a product nowadays is a infinitely delicate balance between building a desirable product, and keeping cost to a minimum. Build something too solid and you'll be outgunned by other more aggressive OEMs with lower prices, build it too cheap and chances are that you'll fork over tons of money for repairs while killing brand loyalty within your customer base. The whole experience showed me just how much stuff goes into release a product and  backing a it with a warranty: it's a big business that involves lots of people, an impressive amount of red tape, and most importantly lots of money.\\n\\nWith the Nvidia chipset fiasco, OEMs like HP (without a doubt one of the hardest hit) stacked all the odds against themselves. Ultimately the problem with these chipset is Nvidia's design error, noteably the use of <a href=\\\"http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1004378/why-nvidia-chips-defective\\\">high-lead bump</a> on their entire lineup as a cost-cutting measure. I won't shed a tear for HP though: their insistence in flooding the market with these cheap Nvidia-based products in both low and mid-end notebook market segments  effectively put a large percentage of their eggs in the same broken basket. This cavalier attitude with matters of risk management cost them  a lot; for a total of just about 3 years, including the 12 additional months of warranty offered by HP after Nvidia admitted their fault, my store's techroom has put 25$ in it's pockets every time it has shipped a unit for repair, countless amounts of motherboards have been replaced, and copious amounts of customers were scared off of HP products despite our best efforts to convince them that newer models were unaffected. With repairs probably costing the OEM  around 100-150$ each (25$ facilitation, ~75-100$ part, ~25-40$ labour &amp; handling) and numerous repairs being a regular occurrence, it's hard to see how an 600$ laptop can remain profitable for very long. And that's just for motherboard repairs; one must consider that  motherboards aren't the only things that break. In many occurrences, the GPU / chipset overheating issues also caused the Wifi card to crap out... being an integrated card, this again warranted a costly replacement of the motherboard. To put it shortly, for a year or two, most of the laptops that HP put on the market were ticking time bombs.\\n\\nBack to Apple. With the company now enjoying a cult status in the world of mainstream computing, Apple is now aggressively expanding. Because of this popularity, their procedures with regards to dealing with customer service issues is somewhat unusual: Apple stores are known to exchange products directly under standard warranty OR AppleCare if the defect is covered. They even go as far as to replaced physically damaged units for new / refurb units for a nominal fee which is more or less equivalent to the average cost that an authorized repair depot gets paid in parts and labour for a warranty repair. One thing that permits this is obviously aggressive demand for Apple products, old or new; people just don't care if the product they're buying is a refurb or not, they just want their laptop / tablet to have an apple on it. Another is the relatively good durability of Apple products, if you ignore certain specific issues that were for the most part corrected.\\n\\nWith the advent of the MacBook Air a few years ago and the introduction of the Retina MBP, Apple is putting this customer service model at risk by putting too much confidence in their products' reliability. The problem is that they can only control their products' quality to a certain extent, and that good design doesn't inherently imply reliability. Event though their quick recall of defective products and pompous announcements of new products are conducive to forgetting them, let's remember that the company has had to deal many times with defective products coming from 3rd party parts integrated in their products. Apple too has been faced with the Nvidia chipset / video problems, and the Seagate 7200.10 recall is also one to remember.\\n\\nNow that almost everything is integrated to the motherboard, risk of facing severe problems that command complicated and expensive motherboard callbacks or repairs are multiplied many times over. Add to that the ever-increasing push for transistor density and performance, and it could very well equate to issues to which Apple possibly couldn't answer with it's usual method of directly exchanging products up front. <a href=\\\"http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/graphics/display/20120216125300_Nvidia_Kepler_Yields_Lower_Than_Expected_Chief_Executive_Officer.html\\\">Nvidia has had problems with yield on the 28nm</a>, which opens up a door for potentially defective products. Intel is now on 22nm fab process, which required them to rethink transistor design: another potentially risky venture. I have no idea how Hynix manufactures their products, but they are clearly not safe from defective products either, seeing that Hynix based RAM sticks are replaced in my store on a daily basis in all brands of laptops and desktops.\\n\\nWhat happens if any of theses components are discovered to be a common point of failure 6 months after the release date? Could Apple maintain their habit of exchanging products up front even if it means writing off expensive motherboards? In the event of a mass recall, could Apple turn around quickly enough to produced a revised revision of a product in order to keep it's customers happy? And if they can, what happens to all those defective unit which would usually end up being sold as refurbs? Can Apple's customer service model survive without this steady stream of replacement products which are essentially built from write-off \\\"scrap\\\"? These are all questions to which, being a simple end-link in the repair chain, I have no answers to. Quite frankly, this has me worried about Apple's future if the \\\"all-in on the motherboard\\\" trend continues.\\n\\nWith all this being said, I don't mean to disrespect to the highly trained engineers and other experts would probably understand the inner workings of marketing electronics much better than I do.

If you're an overall\nenjoyer of fine things, you probably know what I mean; knives, firearms, quality\ntools, engine parts, pretty much anything made of metal to exacting tolerances\nreally, they all  have this special something that makes one feel warm and fuzzy\non the inside when holding, contemplating or using them. Watches definitely fit\ninto that category of items, and ever since the theft of my father's\npass-me-down Citizen chronograph, I've scourged the internet for more\ninformation on watches, to the point where it has become kind of obsessive. The\ninitial goal of my researches the replacement of a lots watch, quickly\ndegenerated into the longing for acquiring a wide variety of watches.\n\nMy first purchased settled on a SKA347, a custom model refreshed by the owner of \nMotor City Watch Works [http://www.motorcitywatchworks.com/index.html] for\nhimself that went up for sale on a forum.\n\n \n[http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/custom-ska3471-e1352148100546.jpg]\n\nAs far as Seikos go, this one isn't exactly all-out custom, but the bead-blasted\nfinish on the entire watch made it noticeably different from it's stock\ncounterpart. The looks were discrete, as they were with my Citizen, and the\nprice was very right... I snatched it on sight. I've been wearing it daily for\nthe past 10 weeks, and I love it. However, an unfortunate bike accident\nscratched the finish on the bracelet, and from that point on I was set on\ngetting a daily beater, something lighter but just as solid, that  I would\ncustomize to be more adequate for harsh use. The venerable SKX007 immediately\nsprung to mind as the perfect base for this project, as it's durability and that\nof it's predecessors being legendary. However, I thought the 007 to be a bit too\ncrowded to my taste.\n\nI got a little bit of inspiration from the Hamilton Khaki Field, a watch which\nwas military issue during WWII and is still available today in a refreshed form.\n\n [http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hamilton_46374b.jpg]\n\nEasily readable, minimal clutter, and a beautiful arabic numeral in a retro\ntypeface at every hour; this is just what I was looking for. The only drawback\nis the fact that a new Hamilton's price tag hovers around the 600-800$ mark, and\nthat sounds awfully expensive for a manual watch, no matter how beautiful and\nwell-built. Building a clone from an SKX007 would get rid of both of those\nproblems.\n\nFirst thing, the stock bezel has to go. This guy named David, of internet fame\non Watchuseek, sells custom turned stainless steel bezels for the 7S26\n[http://www.murphymanufacturing.com/seiko_bezel_2010.html] movements, of which\nthe SKX007 is one amongst many. It looks pretty damn good, here is a comparison,\nstock on the left, blank bezel on the right.\n\n [http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/kmn4erjmwtkfmdzei1-49.jpg]\n\nObviously, the bezel  on the 7s26 case watches is much thicker than that of the\nHamilton, but the 45 degree bevel is reminiscent of the latter's design in a\nway.\n\nA raw stainless casing may be hot stuff around town, but the sheen is not\nsomething you want on a military-style watch based on the Hamilton.

These principles were cheaply copied over from legal works recognizing worker's unions, which are a whole different ball game. None of this seems to matter to supporters of the student movement, because once an organisation dons the name of union, it's natural rights, ie: every single legal concession ever made to union since the beginning of the history, must be recognized by the state. At least according to them. Why? Because anarcho-syndicalism is why: no state can have a say on the righteous acts of a naturally formed union.

From that handout, here is a short exert on the legitimate use of civil disobedience:\\n<blockquote>In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with the willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust  and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over it's injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.</blockquote>\\nI find in this passage wisdom which I have not witnessed in the declarations of student leaders, who were much more revolutionary in their aims. This is another reason why Khadir's likening of the students to MLK is completely ridiculous: the intentions of the latter obviously wanted to use anarchy to their advantage, while to the former this is definitely not the case. MLK shows, in a self-sacrificial way, his utmost respect for the law and the institutions that enforce it, by willingly accepting his sentence as a catalyst to the enlightenment of his peers, an action necessary to the attainment of the greater good. The only likeliness between the students and MLK are the concepts of enlightenment and greater good, which were central to the student movement's rhetoric.\\n\\nAt the light of this, here is my challenge to GND: suck it up. You spearheaded a movement which in it's methods and aims was revolutionary, so of course repression from the existing legal framework was inevitable.

Just get to the courtroom, state off the bat that you will be resorting to your right to silence, and STFU for the entire hearing.

I submit that an individual who\nbreaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust  and who willingly accepts the\npenalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over\nit's injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.\nI find in this passage wisdom which I have not witnessed in the declarations of\nstudent leaders, who were much more revolutionary in their aims. This is another\nreason why Khadir's likening of the students to MLK is completely ridiculous:\nthe intentions of the latter obviously wanted to use anarchy to their advantage,\nwhile to the former this is definitely not the case. MLK shows, in a\nself-sacrificial way, his utmost respect for the law and the institutions that\nenforce it, by willingly accepting his sentence as a catalyst to the\nenlightenment of his peers, an action necessary to the attainment of the greater\ngood. The only likeliness between the students and MLK are the concepts of\nenlightenment and greater good, which were central to the student movement's\nrhetoric.At the light of this, here is my challenge to GND: suck it up. You\nspearheaded a movement which in it's methods and aims was revolutionary, so of\ncourse repression from the existing legal framework was inevitable. Going into\nhigher instances won't work out: your actions, if left unpunished, open up a\ngigantic precedent that makes obedience to court  orders mandatory. No judge\nwill ever let you get away with that. So you have two choices.\n\n 1. Fight till the end to ultimately lose, syphoning union funding left and\n    right as you go. This solution is arguably not the best in terms of greater\n    good: much could have been done with the money you have wasted in\n    procedures, amounts that are in the end paid by the union workers through\n    their contributions to the CSQ, and the public at large through their taxes.\n 2. Quit being such a little bitch and go to jail like a man. Every revolution\n    needs it's martyr, and if you think highly enough of your cause, you'd do\n    like MLK did and be that martyr by submitting to legal authority. The\n    greater good, remember? Take one for the team. If you want to put on a show,\n    ditching your lawyer asking for maximum jail time would surely cause a stir,\n    but there's no need to go through all that. Just get to the courtroom, state\n    off the bat that you will be resorting to your right to silence, and STFU\n    for the entire hearing. Serve your sentence, and enjoy your new-found status\n    of martyred syndicalist, the Michel Chartrand of our generation. Surely your\n    future employers will appreciated this credibility anyways. And hey, if it\n    worked for ending segregation, it'll probably work for obtaining free\n    university-level education, right?\n\nIn times where you lose, the only difference between being a man and a coward is\naccepting full responsibility for your actions. Grow some balls and end\nthis honourably  Here in the land of no-fault, it would be fun to see somebody\ntake responsibility, for a change.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2012-11-10 21:44:00","updated_at":"2012-11-10 21:44:00","published_at":"2012-11-10 21:44:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e4222","uuid":"47106121-dbc0-4cab-8a3d-c5854c74ea5f","title":"Camillus CUDA: Don't be fooled by the gimmicks","slug":"camillus-cuda-dont-be-fooled-by-the-gimmicks","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"<blockquote>A knife, especially a carry piece, is supposed to be a go-to tool, a dependable object that gets the job done 100% of the time.

Derriennic's wealth of knowledge is used to provide practical, down to earth examples of what MIGHT occur in the event of a secession, provided through historical cases both similar and dissimilar. Possible problems and outcomes are provided mostly as bits of counterfactual history, a seldom used methodological tools which is sure to raise a lot of eyebrows. The aim of this method is not to construct a prophecy on the outcome of eventual sovereignty, or to invoke determinisms on the nature of sovereignty. Rather, I felt it to imply a warning that history is too often unpredictable, and that even the most elaborate of scenarios seldom are executed as planned. Where standard-issue federalist weaponry relating to practical means of secession is put to use, it is mostly to highlight the simplistic counterpoints proposed by the separatists (ex.: the implications of hostile unilateral separation on continuity of law).\\n\\nCentral to the argumentation of this essay is a notion of justice which I rather like. The author argues that Quebecois nationalists have an illogical vision of justice, having lamented \\\"oppression of a minority\\\" for decades while being unable to recognize that a winning referendum with a simple majority would create a new microcosm of the very situation they fought against, with the new minority being federalists. Clearly, Derriennic is a democrat, one who has realized that the good in democracy is brought by justice and the institutions that make it possible. There is no \\\"social justice\\\", \\\"justice for minorities\\\", or any other flavor of justice. There is only justice itself, the fair, universal application of law on an individual basis and in conformity with our institutional framework.  Derriennic argues that attempting to apply justice to groups is an error: it polarizes situations and robs the moderates of their power to dampen the decisional process, which has been proven to be a hazard to peace. Lucid on the shortcomings of any type of democracy, he falls back to it's most coherent and immediately efficient form, institutionalism that is not unlike that of Karl Popper.\\n\\nThis book is easily read as a plea for the continuity of the federation, a long form of pro-federative editorial by those who are already convinced of the legitimacy of nationalism. <a href=\\\"http://www.erudit.org/revue/ps/1995/v/n28/040011ar.pdf\\\">A review I found</a> dismissed the essay as unscholarly collection of arguments of bad faith, propaganda spread through authority with little factual backing. I don't think that's the point of this book. The lot of the essai aims to question the  picture-perfect scenarios that are constantly being brought up by both sides. In the scholarly world, it's quite a bold thing to right an essay that has no bibliography or works cited; in this case, it's deliberate provocation, provocation to thought. As such, this book is totally useless to those who are already convinced and unwilling to consider the \\\"what ifs\\\".\\n\\nThe nation-state is concept which in our times is accepted as de facto legitimate and democratic. Benedict Anderson's  <em>Imagined Communities</em> explored how the truistic association of nation and state is historically false, although not totally devoid of legitimacy.  This books continues to attack the legitimacy of the nationalism on the grounds of a concern for universal justice inspired by Kant, specifically in the case of Quebec and while being clear that nationalism does not necessarily imply injustice. This book is definitely a good read for Quebecois who are still on the fence between Yes and No: if you haven't yet consolidated your opinion on nationalism with your conception of justice, this is definitely something to read.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href=\"http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_0045.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-868\" alt=\"IMG_0045\" src=\"http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_0045.jpg?w=480\" width=\"480\" height=\"358\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>Nationalisme et Démocratie: Réflexions sur les illusions des indépendentistes québécois</em> - Jean-Pierre Derriennic</strong></p>\nI'm not gonna lie, I only read this because I'm a fanboy.

Mr. Derriennic is a\nteacher of mine at the political science faculty of the University Laval, and\none of the most recent addition to my personal teacher hall of fame. He's a love\nor hate kind of a person, and word on him is extremely polarized: Ratemyteacher\nhates him [http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=28164] (does ANY\nteacher get love from that site?), and yet there is a 100+ member Facebook\ngroup\npage dedicated to him [https://www.facebook.com/groups/8907689825/]. Me, I guess\nI like him because of the pace he sets. Once this guy is started, the best you\ncan do to stop him is to side-track him with a good question, because there is\njust no stopping him. This man could probably make the Davis filibuster\n[http://blog.sfgate.com/nov05election/2013/07/18/celebrated-texas-lawmaker-wendy-davis-star-of-abortion-law-filibuster-coming-to-sf/] \nlook like a 3rd grade show and tell. He's clear, to the point and doesn't dumb\ndown anything: YOU have to put in extra work if you skipped a beat. His classes\nare a challenge, which is exactly why I took his class on the Middle East last\nsemester.

Introductions to the subject given in CEGEP seemed to highlight the fact that everything concerning philosophy coming out of France was somehow or another an off-shoot of marxism. Obviously, the post-war context made marxism a very important, but was post-war France such a apologist of the soviet model? As it turns out, no. My CEGEP teacher left out a very important nuance when describing the post-war philosophical experience on the old continent, namely that the left branched out in multiple currents which in some cases where a quite radical departure from marxism in it's bastardized form as deployed east the Federal Republic of Germany.\\n\\nThe one thing I really like about Sartre's description of existentialism is exactly what I loath of classical marxism: the role of responsibility. Sartre's idea that human existence is experienced in subjective consciousness, and that this subjectivity is a condemnation to choosing one's own becoming gives the individual the full power over his existence. Existence precedes essence;  in other words, you are what you do. By ignoring God and the divine, Sartre also ignores the possible existence of divinely inspired human essence. Where Nietzsche invites the individual to pillage the corpse of God acquire his power to define existence, Sartre ignores that these powers even exist, and asks us to define them ourselves. If existence where a lock, Nietzsche would have stolen the keys, whereas Sartre would have <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8aQSxXoLFk\\\">impressioned</a> them: fashioned them through the tangibility of our subjective experience. I see in this some sort of enthusiastic nihilism, which exalts man as the master of it's own destiny, the creator of it's essence through it's both his individual and collective actions.\\n\\nSartre seems to see the burden of creating our essence as a good thing, as he states that through this obligation to choose the morals which define our being, man always chooses what is righteous (p.32). To me, this presents a flaw in his philosophy: if we always choose righteousness, then how can we explain wrongful behaviour? His definition of free will allows this to be true, since it implies moral relativity. I was under the impression that relativists consider moral outliers to be necessary yet unmeaningful, the extreme values of a set which cancel each other out when the sum of the set is averaged. While Sartre implies relativism, he doesn't seem fully committed to it. The enthusiasm he demonstrates through the mention of \\\"righteous\\\" moral choice and not moral choice per se, and his  being a proponent of socialism (NOT marxism, as the book tells us), a project which definitely champions certain moral values, is not typical of a relativist. It's as if he hoped that the moral outliers will be more abundant on the side of good; this is obviously incoherent with his conception of free will. This is where I think Nietzsche makes more sense: where he empowers man and gives him the freedom to do what he will, good or evil, Sartre empowers us, only to then discreetly asks us to be nice. Once man is empowered, he has <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNzIKoAy2pk&amp;t=4m14s\\\">no obligation to listen to anybody other than himself</a>.\\n\\nThis book, because it is basically the transcription of a conference, is easy to read. Being derived of the spoken word, it doesn't bear the tricky formulations inherent to philosophical treaties which fully exploit the acuteness of the written word with the trade-off of increased complexity. It's relatively short too.

Descartes himself states that a system with only one author is always more coherent, yet he exposes his ideas on ontology as a prelude to his method without filling in the rest of the blanks. Epistemologically, his appeal for pure reason is interesting and absolutely pertinent; in the larger context of philosophy though, it is hardly consistent enough to be satisfying. The format of this books shows how little there is to be understood from Descartes directly: the edition I have read is a bit under 50% actual transcriptions of the original work, and the rest is contextualization and analysis of it by various authors, citing more heirs of Descartes than the man himself. It's the extrapolation of Descartes by others that makes him interesting. As a consequence, I really cannot recommend this book to anyone who has previously had Descartes explained elsewhere.\\n\\nDon't give yourself the trouble of decoding old french and suffering through  a 350 year old description of the functioning of the human heart; you can get a much better idea of what Descartes is about, much quicker and more pleasurably,  elsewhere.\\n\\nLesson learned: not everything is meant to be read.

External powers have had a heavy hand with Lebanese internal affairs, from the Ottoman empire to European nations, to part of the Nasser-era Arab world and the Israelis, lots of nations have instrumentalized this strategic country. Mid millennia, technology didn't allow  political power to consolidate and centralize, so saying that Mount Lebanon was subject to meddling from external parties would be a bit of an anachronism; feudalism and/or tribalism and/or sectarianism was the norm. The problem is that where other countries politically matured and organized their power, Lebanon remained stuck between what was becoming numerous increasingly hard places (no need for the proverbial rock). Even when an arbitrary decision by European nations gave it fixed borders, it was never really able to assume them fully and get a firm grip on it's internal affairs; the number of unrequested military interventions on it's territory alone is a testament to the state's fragility. This power-vacuum made Lebanon a wild west of the middle east, fertile ground for armed militias to flourish, which they did and still do today to a lesser extent.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my dilemma. What defines a strong state is it's capacity to firmly control it's sovereignty, in matters of territory (non-violation of it's accepted borders) and policy (law and it's application).  In this sense, Lebanon was a weak state. Instinctively throughout my read, I kept thinking to myself that all the uncomfortable situations in which Lebanon put itself could have been avoided with one thing: a strong government. Had any faction truly dominated the country, these incidents would probably never had happened; political dominance of one sect, say, Maronites, would most likely have prevented the repeated Syrian incursions in the country, and further degradation of inter-sectarian relations from the  cycle of swings in the balance of power. The separation of power amongst sects is surely a source of the country's problems, and I don't believe that a strong uni-sectarian executive would have solved that, at least not pacifically. Nation-building in an environment where social domination or homogeneity is unclear leads to bloodshed: in that sense, I don't think that Lebanon could have come about without a minimum of violence. Closing the ethno-religious pressure-cooker with firm control over it's territory could probably have been a catalyst to national unity though, at the  almost assured cost of violence from minority sects.\\n\\nBetween a strong yet oppressive state  and the incapable patchwork of political power that was (still is?) Lebanon, what is to be preferred? The rickety institutions of Lebanon at least get some credit for trying to fix sectarian tensions, but trying visibly wasn't enough. Anarchic freedom resulted in years of bloody conflicts; could the constriction of this freedom in the hands of authoritative power have minimized suffering? The current state of affairs in Egypt seems to argue against this: authoritative rule has been unable to build a truly strong nation. How are we to reconcile freedom and power? Definitely not the topic for this blog post.\\n\\nI'll sleep on it.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-906\" alt=\"IMG_0089\" src=\"http://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/img_0089.jpg?w=480\" width=\"480\" height=\"358\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>A History of Modern Lebanon</em> - Fawwaz Traboulsi</strong></p>\nThis is a book on historical facts about Lebanon, hence very hard to review since I am far from being an expert on Lebanon.

The reading hasn't stopped... however, most of the reading I have done during this period was school stuff that may or may not have been relevant to blog about. Not to mention that working upwards of 30 hours, going to school full time and participating in extra-curricular stuff had the best of me. But that's all behind now, and I plan on doing some catch-up during the Christmas break. </p><p style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\">Sun Tzu, in The Art of War, said the following: \\\"If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperilled in a hundred battles.\\\" I read this book to know my enemy. Enemy might look like a strong word, but if politics is a civilized and institutionalized struggle between forces competing for power as I believe it is, then the usage of the word would be exact. Jean-Francois Lisée is pretty much a polar opposite in terms of political alignment: separatist and Parti Quebecois bigwig, leans left of center, union sympathiser, you get the idea, not exactly my kind of stuff.  Seeing as this book sold quite a lot and that I have heard it been used as reference before in friendly arguments, I thought I'd better read it myself; if the likes of him and the likes of me are ever going to debate something, I'd better be prepared.</p><p style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\">The gist of the book is that it is a response to criticisms often levelled against Quebec and what is called the \\\"Quebecois model\\\", our welfare states system which has a heavy hand in things like employment, culture, health, social issues and business. Most of these criticisms are presented by think-tank-ish organisations like Chambers of Commerce and various institutes centered around business, and are more often than not centered around statistical data. In this book, Lisée attempts to fight fire with fire by responding with different interpretations of statistical data, either by putting things in perspective to delegitimize claims which he (and the left, mostly) believe are blown out of proportion, or by showing that numbers don't necessarily reflect reality.

The left, specially in Quebec, when confronted with empirical evidence about the failure of their model, often offer qualitative responses citing collective choices (\\\"choix de societé\\\", referring to some type of social contract that never was) or ideals which are to be attained, regardless of the costs. While I generally disagree with the left, I can appreciate any politic choice made on solid philosophical grounds... which is why any argument I have with political opponents generally ends up with a discussion on the traditional philosophical problems like the nature of freedom. I hate arguing with statistics; they are the tools of technocrats and pencil pushers, veils with which true political issues are hidden away from sight. I hate to see statistics make policy; the pursuit of goals in the form of numbers alienates humanity, replaces the debate on the ends of human existence with a endless debate on the means of attaining a superficial goal.

Dans la dernière année, les autorités ont cru bon <a href=\\\"http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/montreal/201504/26/01-4864602-37-voitures-uberx-saisies.php\\\">réprimer les chauffeurs Uber</a>, et, comble de l'audace, <a href=\\\"http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/societe/2015/02/10/004-covoiturage-interdit-quebec.shtml\\\">les gens qui font du covoiturage</a>. C'est d'un absurdité totale: le marché et l'initiative populaire vainquent un monopole, et l'État s'empresse de sévir pour le défendre.\\n\\nDevant cette injustice j'ai décidé d'envoyer un courriel au Ministre des transports M. Poëti. Le courriel va comme suit:\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">M. Poëti,</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Je suis un citoyen de la région de Québec, maintenant sans représentant à l’Assemblée depuis le départ de M. Bolduc. Je vous écris pour vous faire part de mon indignation face à la situation actuelle de ciblage des conducteurs offrant des services de transport Uber, les contraventions émises aux gens de ce service, mais aussi à d’honnêtes citoyens qui ont offert des services de covoiturage non affiliés à Uber. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">En 1998, l’Union des Municipalités du Québec présentait à l’Assemblée un mémoire qui faisait état de la flexibilité insuffisante du système de taxi de l’époque pour adéquatement desservir la population. Dix-sept ans plus tard, je fais le même constat, voire pire. L’offre des services de taxis, gangrénés par l’absence d’innovation qu’a invitée le système de permis et tout le carcan réglementaire, se retrouve confrontée à l’innovation née d’une lacune dans leur offre de service. Alors que les compagnies de taxi viennent tout juste de rendre disponible de façon universelle le paiement par carte de débit, Uber offre un produit qui à des années-lumière de tout ce que les compagnies de taxi réussissent a offrir, et ce a moindre cout. Autrement dit, ils ont réussi a passé outre le monopole officiel des services de transport pour offrir un meilleur service, à meilleur prix, rendant caduc le monopole. Ce qu’on constate, c’est l’échec d’un marché régulé. Face à la persécution des chauffeurs Uber et des covoitureurs,tout le monde est en grogne: les utilisateurs, qui sont toujours prisonniers d’une offre de service restreinte, et les chauffeurs de taxi, qui voient leur chasse gardée disparaitre. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Il est facile de comprendre la réaction des chauffeurs de taxi actuels; dans cette situation, ce sont manifestement eux les plus grands perdants. Ils se sont fait avoir une première fois en 1983 par le cartel gouvernemental qui a été mise en place, avec son système de nombre de permis fixe qui les a forcés a déboursé des sommes astronomiques pour la simple obtention d’un permis. Je n’y étais pas, mais fort à parier que personne dans l’industrie n’était très chaud à l’idée de devoir acheter un permis vendu dans un marché où l’offre est artificiellement maintenue basse, démultipliant les prix. Maintenant, ces mêmes chauffeurs de taxi se retrouvent confrontés à l’inévitable réponse à toute offre de service inadéquate, soit l’apparition d’une nouvelle offre. Le présent gouvernement semble ne pas reconnaitre l’échec de ses démarches réglementaires, et selon les nombreuses saisies effectuées dans les centres urbains de la province, semble vouloir à tout prix conserver ce monopole injuste. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Ce que vous demande, c’est de reconnaitre l’échec qu’est la législation sur le service de taxi. Il est compréhensible de légiférer quand le marché connait des ratés; maintenir cette législation en situation où l’offre du marché domine largement et rends inutile un monopole officiel, c’est de l’acharnement et de la folie. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Voici les propositions que j’ai à vous faire pour résoudre l’impasse en ne pénalisant personne. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">-Premièrement, racheter à la valeur marchant les permis des chauffeurs de taxis qui en sont détenteurs, sur plusieurs années s’il le faut. Le gouvernement est directement responsable de leur misère, et ils méritent un dédommagement pour le vol légal auxquels ils ont été soumis pour toutes ces années. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">-Deuxièmement, opérer une solide réforme de la <i>Loi concernant les services de transport par taxi, </i>jusqu’à l’abrogation complète de cette loi. Ceci doit être fait unilatéralement, en confisquant aux municipalités les prérogatives qui ont été déléguées.

Poëti,</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Je suis un citoyen de la région de Québec, maintenant sans représentant à l’Assemblée depuis le départ de M. Bolduc. Je vous écris pour vous faire part de mon indignation face à la situation actuelle de ciblage des conducteurs offrant des services de transport Uber, les contraventions émises aux gens de ce service, mais aussi à d’honnêtes citoyens qui ont offert des services de covoiturage non affiliés à Uber. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">En 1998, l’Union des Municipalités du Québec présentait à l’Assemblée un mémoire qui faisait état de la flexibilité insuffisante du système de taxi de l’époque pour adéquatement desservir la population. Dix-sept ans plus tard, je fais le même constat, voire pire. L’offre des services de taxis, gangrénés par l’absence d’innovation qu’a invitée le système de permis et tout le carcan réglementaire, se retrouve confrontée à l’innovation née d’une lacune dans leur offre de service. Alors que les compagnies de taxi viennent tout juste de rendre disponible de façon universelle le paiement par carte de débit, Uber offre un produit qui à des années-lumière de tout ce que les compagnies de taxi réussissent a offrir, et ce a moindre cout. Autrement dit, ils ont réussi a passé outre le monopole officiel des services de transport pour offrir un meilleur service, à meilleur prix, rendant caduc le monopole. Ce qu’on constate, c’est l’échec d’un marché régulé. Face à la persécution des chauffeurs Uber et des covoitureurs,tout le monde est en grogne: les utilisateurs, qui sont toujours prisonniers d’une offre de service restreinte, et les chauffeurs de taxi, qui voient leur chasse gardée disparaitre. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Il est facile de comprendre la réaction des chauffeurs de taxi actuels; dans cette situation, ce sont manifestement eux les plus grands perdants. Ils se sont fait avoir une première fois en 1983 par le cartel gouvernemental qui a été mise en place, avec son système de nombre de permis fixe qui les a forcés a déboursé des sommes astronomiques pour la simple obtention d’un permis. Je n’y étais pas, mais fort à parier que personne dans l’industrie n’était très chaud à l’idée de devoir acheter un permis vendu dans un marché où l’offre est artificiellement maintenue basse, démultipliant les prix. Maintenant, ces mêmes chauffeurs de taxi se retrouvent confrontés à l’inévitable réponse à toute offre de service inadéquate, soit l’apparition d’une nouvelle offre. Le présent gouvernement semble ne pas reconnaitre l’échec de ses démarches réglementaires, et selon les nombreuses saisies effectuées dans les centres urbains de la province, semble vouloir à tout prix conserver ce monopole injuste. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ce que vous demande, c’est de reconnaitre l’échec qu’est la législation sur le service de taxi. Il est compréhensible de légiférer quand le marché connait des ratés; maintenir cette législation en situation où l’offre du marché domine largement et rends inutile un monopole officiel, c’est de l’acharnement et de la folie. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Voici les propositions que j’ai à vous faire pour résoudre l’impasse en ne pénalisant personne. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">-Premièrement, racheter à la valeur marchant les permis des chauffeurs de taxis qui en sont détenteurs, sur plusieurs années s’il le faut. Le gouvernement est directement responsable de leur misère, et ils méritent un dédommagement pour le vol légal auxquels ils ont été soumis pour toutes ces années. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">-Deuxièmement, opérer une solide réforme de la <i>Loi concernant les services de transport par taxi, </i>jusqu’à l’abrogation complète de cette loi.

Would you rather a liar\nwith an immaculate facade, or a human being who's traits, flaws and life\nexperience shows through, for better or worst? Elections are already popularity\ncontests in which the name of the game is marketing and strategy much more than\nsubstance; lets not make it worst by allowing only those who have social media\nconsultants to be successful.\n\nAla Buzreba is stuck in the perfect storm.

I wish she would have explained herself as she did, but written it\noff, to break this idea that what you said offhand or with a hot head at 16\ninvalidates you from running for office for life. I also wish she would have\ntold those journalists just how disgusted we all are of them going for such low\nhanging fruit, contributing to the widespread political cynicism.

This creates distortions in representativity, because the relation between actual percentage of the national vote for a party and the number of seats it wins is most often completely disproportional. In certain cases, because of voter distribution and varying margins of victory in different ridings, a government can actually come to form a majority government by virtue of winning a majority of seats (and hence have total control over the legislative and executive branches of government) despite NOT having received a majority in nominal votes. This was the case in the 2011 elections, where Mr Harper's Conservative Party assumed total domination of Parliament with just shy of 38% of nominal voter support, a number which shrinks drastically if we consider the fact that the voting population is MUCH smaller than the actual population.

We believe that individuals should be free and bound only by what agreements they have freely agreed to with other parties, be they organizations or individuals. From these axioms, it isn't hard to derive our position on the legitimacy of government in its current form. Ultimately, we'd like as little government as possible (some might even call for... wait for it... no government!), but if any form of representative government is necessary, then its only source of legitimacy can only be whatever bleak reflection of TRUE sovereignty it can garner; in a democracy, this legitimacy would come from a composition of government  that  is representative of the individuals in who's name it devises policy.

This book is his fault. As a matter of fact, many books I own are his fault: I went absolutely nuts one night with his reading list for his Middle East class, and bought something like 200$ of books on Amazon, many of them used. I feel I kinda jumped the gun too soon on some of them... I don't think I have the mental fortitude yet to attack a 1000 page brick on the history of zionism... however this one was a very concise read that I feel is generally useful for both general culture and as a part of my studies. As with <a href=\\\"http://maximerousseau.com/2013/08/25/52b52w-week-6-a-history-of-modern-lebanon/\\\">the book on Lebanon</a>, this post isn't going to be a summary of the content of the book, but rather a wider reflection on what I found interesting during my read. As a factual piece, I don't feel that this book was necessarily the best intro to late 20th century Irak mostly because of it's publishing dates back to 1991 (although most of it sounds like it was written before the end of the Iran-Irak war). This book, while <em>passé</em><em>,</em> was an excellent read.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\">One thing struck me throughout is how everything I  was reading sounded so alien. It was the same kind of feeling that I had when I read that book on Khomeini I have: I had not prior knowledge of what I was reading, nothing for the new material to link up to and to construct sense. That in itself is not surprising, there are probably a lot of things that I ignore everything about. What was surprising is about this book is that it was about Irak, the super-villain from the axis of evil, the country against which the US ground the blade of it's post-Cold War foreign policy, that country that served as a theatre for what was probably the biggest war ever to happen during my teenage years. Saddam and his pitilessness, the Ba'ath and it's violence, the gassing of the Kurdes, the country's military weight, I thought I knew a couple of things on Irak. Turns out I didn't know much, because what I knew was based on events that mostly all took place post-Gulf War. I forgot, probably like others, that before the Gulf War, Irak was still a thing, albeit pale in comparison to other important countries and events at the time, most probably related to the Cold War.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\">This book didn't build on the prior knowledge of the Gulf War, because it hadn't happen yet. This book treats the Iran-Irak war as the end-all moment of the Irakis, and thus builds up the analysis from a much earlier historical experience than just the Ba'ath-&gt;Saddam-&gt;Iran-Irak-&gt;1st Gulf-&gt;2nd Gulfe series of events to which I was exposed in classes and books.  This deepening of the historical analysis for one is very helpful, and the insight on the relatively little known operation of the Iraki Ba'ath from an insider's perspective makes for a very interesting read.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\">From a distance, the historical root causes of phenomenon always appears simpler: you don't NEED to understand the Ba'ath and the founding of the Iraki regime to understand that the US kicked their asses. To understand that Saddam is a ruthless, cunning and bellicose is enough. When a subject is deemed interesting, scholarly analysis is often overabundant, but when events shrinks to insignificance and are noted in the history books, very often it is poor and historically tainted. Researchers in the field of terrorism for example seem to agree that academia is going totally nuts over the phenomenon, making complete mastery of the field a difficult task because of the sheer number of studies based on it. The sad thing about this field is that a few years from now, it is most likely that an infinitely small fraction of all that content will be considered relevant. This book was an excellent reminder that history, while in appearance based on  objective facts, is in practice subject to change.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:left;\\\">Also interesting is the fact that the link between the Iraki Ba'ath and socialism is explored in more detailed, giving an interesting insight in how the arabs, and in a larger frame the third-world, deployed it's own brand of socialism. My curiosity has been piqued by both the theory of Franz Fanon's third-worldism and the pratical application of third-world socialism by Nyerere in Tanzania, and in that respect it was interesting to get the arab perspective on these matters.

Between ad-homs (intended as bait?) and masturbating about how widely he has read, the author does a pretty shitty job of explaining to us why and how anarcho-capitalism sucks, relying mostly on choice arguments such as MUH HUMAN NATURE. I'm not going to white-knight for Tom, simply because he doesn't need my help. I'm not going to refute the piece too, because the concerns Hunter has with anarcho-capitalism have been addressed before. Maybe he hasn't read widely enough. What I am going to do is point out how the underpinning of Maat's \\\"arguments\\\" are essentially the same as those upon which the states builds it's own perverse logic, in that, hopefully make a sound defense of political radicals, a group in which I include libertarians.\\n\\nWhat aggravates libertarians more than anything else about the state is its hubris: how a small group of elected officials, upon manning the controls of apparatus of the state, suddenly come to think of themselves as gods, who with sufficient time and budgetary appropriations can solve everything. Functionaries of the states and their elected political overlords have different interests, but the latter coincide when it comes to making the state look like an all-knowning entity with the power to fix everything. We can make the Middle East democratic. We can save people from their self-destructive habits through nudging and subsidies. We can engineer our way into permanent economic growth. We can provide everything for everyone forever.\\n\\nThis hubris of the state is also that of the technocrat, and apparently, Hunter Maats. While reading his piece, I got the impression that Maats' point was that if only everybody read as much New York Times best sellers as he did, we could finally move towards an improved society; if only everybody accepted consensus opinions on subjects like \\\"human nature\\\", we'd have a solid foundation upon which we can build a better society. In doing this, Hunter commits what should amount to a cardinal sin to anybody who believes in science: he behaves as if he had found pure, eternal, objective truth between the covers of paperbacks. His pretension to be able to build politics upon a solid foundation is nonsensical:  firstly because it is epistemically unsound, and secondly because understanding politics as science is absurd<strong>*</strong>.\\n\\nModernity was built on doubt; such a well read person as Maats aught to know this. Descartes methodological doubt constitutes the basis for modern science, and thinkers like Karl Popper who have built upon it have shed light upon one of the foremost criteria of truth: falsifiability. In the face of science, the  soundest of knowledge is to be questioned, all fact is provisional by definition. Men and women of science aught to be humbled by this sword of Damocles inherent to the process of discovering and rediscovering truth. Knowledge is a shaky edifice by virtue of the fact that it's building-blocks are subject to crumble at any time. When he makes cocksure pronouncements on the existence of an essence of man or processes of evolution on the scale of universe, what Maats is doing isn't science; he's simultaneously praying at the altar of science and desecrating it with his arrogance.\\n\\nIronically, the Austrian school of economics, the works of which Maats refers to as mental masturbation, does a much better job at being humble in it's view of the science of economics. To be sure, the Austrian methodology could be critiqued, but its insistance that economic preferences are subjective and largely impenetrable are a sign of committal to the idea that some things simply can't be perfectly revealed through science.\\n\\nSo, one could say that Maat's refutation of anarcho-capitalism in favour of governance based on science is significantly weakened by the fact that he fails to acknowledge that every bit of knowledge he builds his case on could be proven to be completely false. What completely demolishes his case against Woods / libertarians / ancaps is his complete lack of understanding of what this person and groups are about fundamentally.\\n\\nThe libertarian mouvement is a political one. This implies that it interacts with other mouvements, actors and institutions that are contemporary to us; it attempts to influence the status quo in a manner coherent with it's founding principles. Hunter portraits the movement as striving for the establishment, <em>ex-nihilo, </em>of a stateless society; this is of course ridiculous, because politics is by it's very nature a process. How did we get here, politically? According to historians and scholars on nationalism like Benedict Anderson, the state was formed around the state-sponsorship of an official culture through things like language and education, progressively asserting itself as a incarnation of the collective will which bore much more legitimacy than that of divine-right monarchs. Democracy is a relatively recent ideal which best channels this ideal of legitimacy, and which has been proven to be robust, if imperfect. There is no pivotal moment where our current institutions magically appeared. There is no teleological \\\"march of progress\\\" leading up to democracy and the modern state. What we have before us is the results of human action, the slow process of humans shaping their environments through interacting with one another.\\n\\nWe libertarians, the political ones at least, wish to participate in this process for the betterment for our society. We are well aware of our institutional surroundings, as demonstrated by our eagerness to criticize the state, its innate immorality and spectacular shortcomings. I know of nobody who wishes to achieve the libertarian ideals while ridding ourselves of what good things we have invented collectively (the idea of courts and arbitration of disputes, social institutions, and even *GASP* roads!), but this does not mean we do not carry a utopian vision of what we would want society to look like. This utopia is a guiding light, in the same way the sun, moon and stars can be used for navigation despite being out of reach. If politics is constantly in movement and evolution, this ideal is the direction of our vector, not a mere point.\\n\\nIn a sense, Maats is attempting to discredit an inherently political concept, the ideology of libertarianism, in strictly apolitical terms. In his article and follow-up tweet to me, he makes it sound like being political is a bad thing, and that science alone can yield a better future. Is he forgetting that the Kants and Rousseaus that he likes to namedrop where also guided by an ideal, and imminent political? Is he denying that their ideas had an influence on the foundation of our societies, despite their respective utopias never having been achieved? In citing Diamond, Pinker, <em>et al</em> as \\\"evidence\\\" (his words) of some sort of human nature and transcendant process towards progress, he discards the role of human action in the shaping or our world. The thinkers, the people that their ideas sway, the practitioners of politics and the masses they mobilized, the groups that coalesced around this or that aim or objective, they are the real force behind the creation of our societal order. The very idea of the contemporary nation-state that is so dear to Hunter was borne of an assembly of myths, from the social contract to the \\\"collective will\\\". What is to say that ideas can't change the current order of things?\\n\\nIn his attempt to evacuate politics in order to assume the stance of the \\\"realist\\\" (again, his words), Maats dons the robes of the soul-less technocrat, eager to engineer a better future but all too quick to forget the human beings that will inhabit it. Like the state, he adopts a quasi-religious belief in the \\\"just a bit more effort\\\" mentality and carefully plans a map to the exact location of what turns out to be a mirage of brighter tomorrow. In the end, the only place he's bound to end up after much adjustment, readjustment and sensible choices is further down the road to serfdom. The real enemies of human progress aren't on the ideologues on the left or the right, who dare imagine a different world. The real threat, if one indeed does exist, are radical centrists like Maats, who look to smother the act of politics in what they perceive to be truth.\\n\\nRadicals, keep doing what you do, your ideas and actions are the engine of history. Hunter, once you're done beating off to best-sellers, you can come out and play too.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n*This claim might sound weird coming from a political scientist. In the french language, there exists a distinction between <em>la politique </em>and <em>le politique. </em>The first refers to the conduct of politics, the interaction between political actors (campaigning, coalition forming, media ops, etc), while the second refers to the abstract notion of the affairs of the state and governance. Here, I am referring to <em>la politique.</em> To be sure, my discipline, in so far as it concerns the analysis of public policy, voter behaviour and scholarly analysis of political situations is absolutely a science.

Under the guise of conducting research,\nI've come to join and like an absolutely inordinate amount of\npolitically-inclined shitposting groups and pages. It's bad, to the point where\nnormie posts about meals, trips and life achievements have been completely\ndrowned out in political compass memes\n[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/political-compass] and ancap smileys\n[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/anarcho-capitalism]. Right around the\ntime where radical centrist memes began making an appearance in my favourite\nmeme group [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1746526505589609/?fref=nf], I became\naware of a piece by Hunter Maats\n[http://www.mixedmentalarts.club/single-post/2016/12/16/Anarcho-Capitalism-What-Happens-When-Piggy-Visits-His-Fantasy-Island] \nwhich perfectly represents everything that's wrong behind the idea that inspired\nthe meme.\n\n \n[https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-11-at-10-58-58-pm.png] \nThis is what Hunter Maats looks like. See the original tweet in context\n[https://twitter.com/max302/status/810710069729959936].\n\nIn his extremely verbose article, Maats perform an intricate kata of mixed\nmental arts, chopping down conveniently constructed straw men built up in the\nshape of Tom Woods [http://tomwoods.com], intended to be a sit-in for the entire\nideology of anarcho-capitalism. Between ad-homs (intended as bait?) and\nmasturbating about how widely he has read, the author does a pretty shitty job\nof explaining to us why and how anarcho-capitalism sucks, relying mostly on\nchoice arguments such as MUH HUMAN NATURE. I'm not going to white-knight for\nTom, simply because he doesn't need my help. I'm not going to refute the piece\ntoo, because the concerns Hunter has with anarcho-capitalism have been addressed\nbefore. Maybe he hasn't read widely enough. What I am going to do is point out\nhow the underpinning of Maat's \"arguments\" are essentially the same as those\nupon which the states builds it's own perverse logic, in that, hopefully make a\nsound defense of political radicals, a group in which I include libertarians.\n\nWhat aggravates libertarians more than anything else about the state is its\nhubris: how a small group of elected officials, upon manning the controls of\napparatus of the state, suddenly come to think of themselves as gods, who with\nsufficient time and budgetary appropriations can solve everything. Functionaries\nof the states and their elected political overlords have different interests,\nbut the latter coincide when it comes to making the state look like an\nall-knowning entity with the power to fix everything. We can make the Middle\nEast democratic. We can save people from their self-destructive habits through\nnudging and subsidies. We can engineer our way into permanent economic growth.\nWe can provide everything for everyone forever.\n\nThis hubris of the state is also that of the technocrat, and apparently, Hunter\nMaats. While reading his piece, I got the impression that Maats' point was that\nif only everybody read as much New York Times best sellers as he did, we could\nfinally move towards an improved society; if only everybody accepted consensus\nopinions on subjects like \"human nature\", we'd have a solid foundation upon\nwhich we can build a better society. In doing this, Hunter commits what should\namount to a cardinal sin to anybody who believes in science: he behaves as if he\nhad found pure, eternal, objective truth between the covers of paperbacks. His\npretension to be able to build politics upon a solid foundation is nonsensical:\n firstly because it is epistemically unsound, and secondly because understanding\npolitics as science is absurd*.\n\nModernity was built on doubt; such a well read person as Maats aught to know\nthis. Descartes methodological doubt constitutes the basis for modern science,\nand thinkers like Karl Popper who have built upon it have shed light upon one of\nthe foremost criteria of truth: falsifiability. In the face of science, the\n soundest of knowledge is to be questioned, all fact is provisional by\ndefinition. Men and women of science aught to be humbled by this sword of\nDamocles inherent to the process of discovering and rediscovering truth.\nKnowledge is a shaky edifice by virtue of the fact that it's building-blocks are\nsubject to crumble at any time. When he makes cocksure pronouncements on the\nexistence of an essence of man or processes of evolution on the scale of\nuniverse, what Maats is doing isn't science; he's simultaneously praying at the\naltar of science and desecrating it with his arrogance.\n\nIronically, the Austrian school of economics, the works of which Maats refers to\nas mental masturbation, does a much better job at being humble in it's view of\nthe science of economics. To be sure, the Austrian methodology could be\ncritiqued, but its insistance that economic preferences are subjective and\nlargely impenetrable are a sign of committal to the idea that some things simply\ncan't be perfectly revealed through science.\n\nSo, one could say that Maat's refutation of anarcho-capitalism in favour of\ngovernance based on science is significantly weakened by the fact that he fails\nto acknowledge that every bit of knowledge he builds his case on could be proven\nto be completely false. What completely demolishes his case against Woods /\nlibertarians / ancaps is his complete lack of understanding of what this person\nand groups are about fundamentally.\n\nThe libertarian mouvement is a political one. This implies that it interacts\nwith other mouvements, actors and institutions that are contemporary to us; it\nattempts to influence the status quo in a manner coherent with it's founding\nprinciples. Hunter portraits the movement as striving for the establishment,\nex-nihilo,of a stateless society; this is of course ridiculous, because politics\nis by it's very nature a process. How did we get here, politically? According to\nhistorians and scholars on nationalism like Benedict Anderson, the state was\nformed around the state-sponsorship of an official culture through things like\nlanguage and education, progressively asserting itself as a incarnation of the\ncollective will which bore much more legitimacy than that of divine-right\nmonarchs. Democracy is a relatively recent ideal which best channels this ideal\nof legitimacy, and which has been proven to be robust, if imperfect. There is no\npivotal moment where our current institutions magically appeared. There is no\nteleological \"march of progress\" leading up to democracy and the modern state.\nWhat we have before us is the results of human action, the slow process of\nhumans shaping their environments through interacting with one another.\n\nWe libertarians, the political ones at least, wish to participate in this\nprocess for the betterment for our society. We are well aware of our\ninstitutional surroundings, as demonstrated by our eagerness to criticize the\nstate, its innate immorality and spectacular shortcomings. I know of nobody who\nwishes to achieve the libertarian ideals while ridding ourselves of what good\nthings we have invented collectively (the idea of courts and arbitration of\ndisputes, social institutions, and even GASP roads!), but this does not mean we\ndo not carry a utopian vision of what we would want society to look like. This\nutopia is a guiding light, in the same way the sun, moon and stars can be used\nfor navigation despite being out of reach. If politics is constantly in movement\nand evolution, this ideal is the direction of our vector, not a mere point.\n\nIn a sense, Maats is attempting to discredit an inherently political concept,\nthe ideology of libertarianism, in strictly apolitical terms. In his article and\nfollow-up tweet to me, he makes it sound like being political is a bad thing,\nand that science alone can yield a better future. Is he forgetting that the\nKants and Rousseaus that he likes to namedrop where also guided by an ideal, and\nimminent political? Is he denying that their ideas had an influence on the\nfoundation of our societies, despite their respective utopias never having been\nachieved? In citing Diamond, Pinker,et al as \"evidence\" (his words) of some sort\nof human nature and transcendant process towards progress, he discards the role\nof human action in the shaping or our world. The thinkers, the people that their\nideas sway, the practitioners of politics and the masses they mobilized, the\ngroups that coalesced around this or that aim or objective, they are the real\nforce behind the creation of our societal order. The very idea of the\ncontemporary nation-state that is so dear to Hunter was borne of an assembly of\nmyths, from the social contract to the \"collective will\". What is to say that\nideas can't change the current order of things?\n\nIn his attempt to evacuate politics in order to assume the stance of the\n\"realist\" (again, his words), Maats dons the robes of the soul-less technocrat,\neager to engineer a better future but all too quick to forget the human beings\nthat will inhabit it. Like the state, he adopts a quasi-religious belief in the\n\"just a bit more effort\" mentality and carefully plans a map to the exact\nlocation of what turns out to be a mirage of brighter tomorrow.

Either way, Irwin seems to rejet both on the grounds that they too readily separate real life and abstract philosophical pondering, thus making the individual inclined to shed his make-believe morality whenever it would be convenient for him or her. Much like a person cannot easily shed an identity that it has itself construct, I don't believe that the kind of moral fictionalism I am describing can so easily be shed.

To be sure, a lot of the discussion of libertarianism I\nhave encountered through my contact with like-minded folks both inside and\noutside of the party remains either very technical or heavily reliant on moral\nfacts deemed objective, but I was pleased to have discussions that went far\nbeyond that at times. Metaphysics, ontology, epistemology often came to be\nmentioned.\n\n \n[http://maximerousseau.com/2016/05/19/the-free-market-existentialist-review-and-musings/510uhacaxel-_sx329_bo1204203200_/]\n\nIf there was any doubt in my mind left about the depth and breadth of\nlibertarian thinkers, my recent reading of William Irwin'sThe Free Market\nExistentialist: Capitalism Without Consumerismhas succeeded in washing it away.\nIn a political environment where many (most?) adepts believe in some kind of\nobjective reality, either through Randian objectivism, or through the morala\nprioriof natural rights or the non-aggression principle, Irwin confronts the\npack by offering a coherent system of belief that ties in the metaphysics of\npost-modernity with the political ideals of libertarianism. He reconsiders\nexistentialism in a way which rids it's wrongfully applied stigma of having been\nshared by the apologist of totalitarianism that was Sartre, drawing on others\nwho have helped shaped the idea before it's rise to fame, notably Nietzsche.\nAfter having rid existentialism of it's Sartrian burden, he makes a perfectly\nsound case for the mutual complementarity of existentialism and capitalism, two\nsystems that promote self-ownership and self-determination on the ontological\nand material fronts, respectively. The book then suggests alternative ways of\ndefining ethics in the metaphysical void which characterises existentialism. I\nwas taken by surprise about the inclusion of a full chapter on evolutionary\nethics, a field that I have never even heard of that ties in evolutionary\nbiology with the ethics of human behavior. The book ends with two chapters on\nproperty rights and the minimal state, which offers libertarian alternatives to\ncurrent political organization that are coherent with the metaphysically\nexistentialistic and anti-moral position presented in the previous chapters.\n\nIf not for anything else, this book is important because it confronts\nlibertarians with ideas that are widely accepted within our scene, to the point\nof being taken at face value by most. Perspective is easy to lose in today's\nworld, an age where content is custom-tailored to us on various social media\nplatforms, inevitably creating what amounts to high-tech echo chambers. Patting\neach other on the back for accepting the NAP is unlikely to produce productive\ndebate and further advance the philosophical positions within our movement; in\nthat, Irwin's book is a helpful reminder that knowing the strengths AND\nweaknesses of the philosophical underpinnings of libertarianism is the best way\nof comfortable in presenting and debating it.\n\nOf course, the book has several other merits. Amongst which, it looks to be easy\nenough to read for the casual reader, with a very straightforward presentation\nof the arguments in favour of the author's position. Being intimately familiar\nwith the French obsession with footnoted references and comments which are\nimmensely distracting visually, I can appreciate the authors (editors?) choice\nof placing all references and notes at the end of each chapter, thus making the\nbook easier to read for everybody while still providing an important list of\nrelated materials for those who would like to supplement their reading lists.\n\nOne of its other strong merits is that it rings many bells in the post-modern\nmind: metaphysical nihilism which results on near-absolute moral relativism and\nevolutionary biology are ideas which individuals from all post-war generations,\nwith exception of a few rabid religious fanatics, accept as true to some extent.\nAt the very least, all are familiar with them. Irwin builds on these ideas which\nare current and resonate with the times, making for a potent book that, for all\nits use in shaking up existing libertarians, also has what it needs to win over\nnew converts. Its unpretentious style and presentation only helps to make the\nbook more accessible to others who might be in another corner of the political\nspectrum.\n\nIf I were to have one criticism of the book, it would be on Irwin's dismissal of\nRichard Joyce's definition of moral fictionalism as incompatible with\nexistentialistic ethos. While I'd agree that holding beliefs of moral realism\nwhich we know to be false is inauthentic, it seems to me that there is another\nway of imagining fictionalism which would relate to the existentialist ideal of\nself-definition. Couldn't moral frameworks, in addition to being inherited\nthrough evolution, be shaped by the individual through empirical experience?\nWhat I have in mind is something akin to Popperian epistemology applied to\nmorals. Confronted with the impossibility of empirically testing the outcome of\nevery moral position, some things have to be taken asa prioriknowledge: this\nwould be evolutionary core morality. The incapability of proving moral\nobjectivity provides the grounds for falsification at all times, and the process\nof falsifying pre-existing moral positions is done through individual,\nsubjective experience. As such, a person who empirically experiences that lying\ngenerally has negative consequences can maintain the fiction that lying is bad,\nwhile knowing that there is probably no objective grounds to defend this. Having\nnot read Joyce, there is little doubt that I am going well over what definition\nhe made of fictionalism; maybe it is closer to Olson's moral conservationism.\nEither way, Irwin seems to rejet both on the grounds that they too readily\nseparate real life and abstract philosophical pondering, thus making the\nindividual inclined to shed his make-believe morality whenever it would be\nconvenient for him or her. Much like a person cannot easily shed an identity\nthat it has itself construct, I don't believe that the kind of moral\nfictionalism I am describing can so easily be shed. Not unlike with science,\nsuch fictionalism would promote gradual evolutions in morality, possibly with\noccasional breakthroughs,  but nothing that would permit jumping and out of\nmoral belief systems at will.\n\nSpeaking on Rawls and his Theory of Justice, one of my philosophy teachers told\nus in that the 20th century had been incredibly stale in terms of innovations in\nthe field of political philosophy, and that environment, Rawls' Theory of\nJustice was a beacon of light when it came out. Considering the fact that\nlibertarianism is largely based on ideas that hark back to Locke and Smith, I'd\nargue that Irwin has the potential to be the libertarian equivalent of Rawls.\nNozick rivaled Rawls in terms of his systematic approach to think of justice,\nbut it's precisely this fact that made him, in my opinion, under-read in\nlibertarian circles: he's just not a fun read. Much like Rawls, Irwin throws the\ngroundwork for heated debate both within our circles and outside of them, he\npresents a position which is both unusual and well grounded in literature, and\nhe makes his point in that is accessible and layman-friendly. All of those\nfactors make it, in my opinion, a very important contribution to political\nscience and political philosophy as a whole, and to libertarianism in\nparticular.\n\nYou can get Irwin's book on Amazon\n[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119121280/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1119121280&linkCode=as2&tag=max302-20&linkId=EUD6CALLFXLB6KWO]\n, and check out his academic page [http://staff.kings.edu/wtirwin/] for more\ninfo on his work.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2016-05-19 15:45:12","updated_at":"2016-05-19 15:45:12","published_at":"2016-05-19 15:45:12","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e4237","uuid":"0b922fb1-c50b-4ed2-95a6-57739ef59fd5","title":"The Libertarian Case for Bernier","slug":"the-libertarian-case-for-bernier","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Libertarian discussion groups on Facebook are filled with vitriol, and that's putting it lightly.

It focused on why Trump is not going to be a boon for foreign policy realists, but it was also loaded with other assessments on realism's \\\"failures\\\" which I think are probably more important than the piece's main thesis. While denouncing the Center for National Interest's (CNI) increasingly lenient stance on Trump's wishy-washy idea of a foreign policy agenda, he lambasts realists for shirking policy-making and staying within the comfort of academia, failing to provide a compelling narrative for America's role in the world, and not being sufficiently organized in ways that can  influence policy. The take-away is that because they fail at implementing policy, realists tend to flock to strong-men like Donald Trump to \\\"save\\\" them.\\n\\nWhile his criticism of the realist movement regarding its absence from policy circles is accurate, I don't believe that realism has \\\"failed\\\" as he implies it, or that it needs a saviour like Trump. In his anger at the CNI's position on Trump, he seems to have painted realism with broad strokes, and forgotten what it is fundamentally about. The question of Trump being a messiah for realists or not is relevant; a much better question would be what realism is, is not and can be, with or without him.\\n\\nLet's remind ourselves of just what realism is exactly: it is a theoretical framework which uses certain premises on the nature of states and the international system to predict the formers behaviour in the latter. The universally accepted premises are well known and widely adhered to in international relations writ large: the international system is anarchic, and states have survival as their first and foremost interest. There are some divergences on the finer points of states' behaviors and how they go about surviving, but generally, those two premises is something all realists rally around. I'm certain that this is nothing that Mr. Kirss is not intimately familiar with. This framework is used to understand international relations in it's broad strokes, which all the but the most obstinate realists having no pretension to it's capacity to explain everything. What's more, realism in itself carries no inherent normative ideal of how international relations SHOULD function, unlike other schools, notably everything derived from liberalism. To be sure, it is used by many to predict outcomes on the international scene, but it does so in a fatalistic way which considers states to be a certain way by nature. There is no teleologic goal built in to the framework, no gold standard to progress towards. Liberals have things like world peace and prosperity as a goal, and advocate reaching it through different means depending on their understanding on the international system, and this is how you get institutionalists and interventionists; the only thing we realists have it the sisyphean cycle of balancing and checking, buck-passing and bandwagoning into new international orders every so often.\\n\\nIf the academic conception of realism does not invite normative policy recommendations by design, then the obvious question is the following: what do realist policy recommendations look like?

Sans grande surprise, le projet de loi réitère \\\"l'ancien régime\\\" de transport par taxi réglementé par le fédéral, rendant ainsi des services alternatifs comme Über formellement illégal. Par contre, le projet accompli beaucoup plus que de simplement renforcer le régime en place: il arroge au gouvernement plusieurs autres pouvoirs en matière de transport par taxi, en modifiant certains structures en place et en instaurant d'autre. Voici donc un résumé des points saillants du projet de loi dans sa forme actuelle, avec chaque article ou alinéa pertinent  cité et commenté.\\n\\nSauf sur avis contraire, toutes les modifications affectent la <a href=\\\"http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/S_6_01/S6_01.html\\\"><em>Loi concernant les services de transport par taxi </em>tel que publié sur internet en date d'aujourd'hui. </a> Bien que le projet de loi modifie aussi le <em>Code de la sécurité routière</em> et la <em>Loi sur le ministère des transports,</em> et d'autres lois, les changements apportés dans ceux-ci ne font qu'appuyer les dispositions de la première loi modifiée.\\n\\n<strong>Article 1, Alinea 2:</strong>\\n<blockquote>2° par l’insertion, après « services offerts » de « , d’assurer une gestion de l’offre de services de transport par taxi qui tient compte des besoins de la population ».</blockquote>\\nCette modification sur un article de préambule de la loi<em> </em>montre l'intention du gouvernement de continuer d'oeuvre comme seul acteur capable de determiner l'offre de transport. Rappelons que le système de gestion de l'offre sous forme de permis est ce qui a causé la présence d'Über en premier lieu.\\n\\n<strong>Article 2:</strong>\\n\\nL'article 2 fait des modifications massives au définitions légales de ce que comporte le transport, le covoiturage, et autres items pertinents. Nous allons l'analyser en plusieurs segments.\\n<blockquote>« 2° « intermédiaire en services de transport par taxi », toute personne qui fournit, par tout moyen, à des titulaires d’un permis de propriétaire de taxi ou à des titulaires d’un permis de chauffeur de taxi des services de publicité, de répartition de demandes de services de transport par taxi ou d’autres services de même nature;</blockquote>\\nModifiant la même loi existante, on fait l'effort d'étendre la couverture de la définition existante d'un intermédiaire en services de transport par taxi pour, probablement pour mieux pouvoir inclure Über ou d'autres services alternatifs.\\n<blockquote>« 3° « services de transport par taxi », tout service de transport rémunéré de personnes par automobile, à l’exception des suivants:</blockquote>\\nLa définition formelle de taxi est ajoutée à la loi. Sinon que préambule, il n'y a aucune allusion à une tel définition formelle dans la forme actuelle de la loi. Les exemptions qui étaient autrefois présentes à l'article 3 de cette même loi sont maintenant énumérés à même l'article 2.\\n<blockquote>a) le covoiturage effectué sur une partie ou l’ensemble d’un même parcours, à la condition que :\\n\\ni. l’automobile utilisée soit un véhicule de promenade au sens de l’article 4 du Code de la sécurité routière (chapitre C-24.2);\\n\\nii. le conducteur décide de la destination finale et que la prise de passagers à bord soit accessoire à la raison pour laquelle il se déplace;\\n\\niii. le transport soit offert moyennant une contribution financière qui se limite, quel que soit le nombre de personnes à bord de l’automobile, aux frais d’utilisation de celle-ci et dont le montant total n’excède pas celui de l’indemnité accordée à un employé d’un ministère ou d’un organisme dont le personnel est nommé suivant la Loi sur la fonction publique (chapitre F-3.1.1) pour l’utilisation de son véhicule personnel;</blockquote>\\nLe dossier du covoiturage en est un qui a certes eu moins de publicité que les déboires de Über, mais qui est connexe et tout à fait important, puisqu'il constitute aussi du \\\"transport illégal\\\" au Québec. Les barèmes sont maintenants fixés: l'intention du conducteur et la rémunération sont les critères qui identifient la légalité ou non du covoiturage. Cette définition laisse encore trop de place aux abus de zèle de la part des policiers: l'intention est sujette à interpretation, et la limite des contributions sous-entends encore que de faire un peu d'argent pour services rendus est inacceptable. Les couts d'opération d'un véhicule pourraient être fortement débattus, et je ne me surprendrais pas de voir des défenses être faites sur les bases des coûts totaux d'opération engendrés par les chauffeurs. Un seuil absolu de contributions est aussi établi au même niveau que les indemnités pour utilisation de véhicules personnels accordés au fonctionnaires,  comme si les couts d'opération étaient uniformes.\\n\\n<strong>Article 5, Alinea 2</strong>\\n<blockquote>3° par l’ajout, à la fin, de l’alinéa suivant :\\n\\n« Malgré le premier alinéa, lorsque l’automobile servant au transport par taxi est mue entièrement au moyen de l’énergie électrique, la Commission des transports du Québec peut autoriser le titulaire du permis de propriétaire de taxi à posséder le nombre d’automobiles supplémentaires mues entièrement au moyen de l’énergie électrique qu’elle détermine pour s’assurer que le titulaire du permis puisse continuer d’offrir des services pendant le temps de la recharge. ».</blockquote>\\nM. Taillefer a manifestement une excellente équipe de lobbyiste. Téo pourra avoir un nombre plus grand de voitures immatriculées T que ce que ne lui permet le nombre de permis de taxi en sa possession, dans l'objectif de faire une rotation en période de charge. À noter que le soin de determiner la taille de la flotte de reserve est entièrement à la discretion de l'exploitant. Je ne voudrais pas attribuer à Téo l'intention d'abuser de leur capacité de reserve, mais il faut au moins constater que le potentiel d'abus y est.\\n\\n<strong>Article 6</strong>\\n<blockquote>«5.1. Le gouvernement détermine le nombre d’agglomérations et le territoire de chacune d’elles. Le ministre rend publique cette décision sur le site Internet de son ministère.»</blockquote>\\nIci, une addition est fait pour rendre formel le contrôle du ministère des transports sur le nombre de permis. Le contrôle effectif n'a pas changé, puisque les nombres de permis pouvant êtres attribués par la Commission des transports du Québec (CTQ) était déjà une prérogative ministérielle. À noter que l'article suivant donne aussi la prérogative au ministère de determiner ce que constitue une agglomeration, ce qui est actuellement une tâche de la CTQ. Cherche-t'on d'autres structures à abolir?\\n\\n<strong>Article 8</strong>\\n<blockquote>«6.1. Un titulaire de permis de propriétaire de taxi peut offrir de transporter plusieurs personnes ayant demandé séparément une course vers une même destination ou vers plusieurs destinations à l’intérieur du même parcours, à la condition que cette course soit demandée par un moyen technologique permettant à chaque client d’accepter à l’avance le partage des frais de la course. ».</blockquote>\\nPremier référant plus explicite à des modes alternatifs de contractualiser les transports. L'imaginaire de nos législateur n'est pas totalement desséchée, puisqu'à ma connaissance, un tel système n'a pas encore été mis en oeuvre pas aucun des nouveau joueurs.\\n\\n<strong>Article 10</strong>\\n<blockquote>« 10.1. Le gouvernement peut, pour chaque agglomération qu’il indique, fixer le nombre maximal de permis de propriétaire de taxi pouvant être délivrés par la Commission selon, le cas échéant, les catégories de services qu’il identifie et les conditions qu’il détermine. ».</blockquote>\\nEncore ici, la CTQ se voit confisquer une prérogative: c'est maintenant le gouvernement qui émettra par décret le nombre de permis approprié. D'autres amendements aux articles 9 et 11 complète cette modification.\\n\\n<strong>Article 15</strong>\\n<blockquote>15. L’article 50 de cette loi est modifié par le remplacement de « d’appels » par « de demandes de services de transport par taxi ».</blockquote>\\nAutre modification mineur pour plus facilement inclure les services décentralisés à la Über. À noter que l'article 34 de la loi rendais déjà illégal le fait de faire du \\\"dispatch\\\" sans un permis approprié; elle a aussi été modifiée pour que sont interpretation puisse être plus large.\\n\\n<strong>Article 19</strong>\\n<blockquote>[...]\\n\\n«Le prix d’une course peut également différer des tarifs établis par la Commission, selon le moyen technologique utilisé pour effectuer la demande de service de transport par taxi, dans la mesure et aux conditions prévues par règlement du gouvernement. ».</blockquote>\\nLe but de cette disposition n'est pas claire. Un client pourra-t'il profiter de meilleurs tarifs si il utiliser une application pour commander son taxi, et inversement, cette disposition ouvre-t'elle la porte à une surcharge pour les appels au \\\"dispatchs\\\" téléphoniques? Pourquoi accorder à certains joueurs l'avantage de pouvoir baisser leur prix en augmentant l'efficacité avec de l'innovation quand Über s'est fait reprocher de faire justement cela? Ici encore, cette exception semble faite spécifiquement pour Téo.\\n\\n<strong>Article 25</strong>\\n<blockquote>«71.1. Un agent de la paix ou un employé autorisé à cette fin par une autorité municipale ou supramunicipale chargée de l’application de la présente loi qui a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu’une personne contrevient au paragraphe 2° de l’article 117 suspend sur-le-champ, au nom de la Société, et pour une période de sept jours, le permis délivré à cette personne en vertu de l’article 61 du Code de la sécurité routière (chapitre C-24.2) l’autorisant à conduire une automobile.\\n\\nLorsque la personne n’est pas titulaire d’un permis l’autorisant à conduire une automobile ou est titulaire d’un permis délivré par une autre autorité administrative, l’agent de la paix ou l’employé autorisé suspend sur-le-champ, au nom de la Société et pour une période de sept jours, le droit de cette personne d’obtenir un permis d’apprenti-conducteur, un permis probatoire ou un permis de conduire.</blockquote>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/transports/201602/23/01-4953693-daoust-envisage-la-suspension-du-permis-des-chauffeurs-duber.php\\\">Les menaces de Daoust s'avèrent vraies</a>: des permis seront suspendus sur-le-champ pour les contrevenants. Si la loi actuelle permettait déjà une saisi du véhicule, mesure que les divers corps de police municipaux ont eu recours à outrance, ce sera maintenant le véhicule ET le permis qui sera confisqué. À noter que ces dispositions s'applique aussi au covoiturage, puisque que ce dernier rentre dans les définition d'un infraction à la loi à l'article 117.\\n\\n<strong>Article 31, alinéa 5</strong>\\n<blockquote>«2.2° fixer, pour toute période qu’il détermine, des droits annuels additionnels pour l’obtention, le maintien ou le renouvellement des permis de propriétaire de taxi qu’il indique, dont le montant peut varier en fonction de chaque agglomération, des catégories de services identifiées et des conditions déterminées en vertu du paragraphe 1.1° ou du nombre de permis détenus par un même titulaire;</blockquote>\\nSi la loi actuelle fait allusion a des droits annuels, elle ne mentionne pas que le nombre de permis détenus par un même titulaire pourrait être un facteur determinant sur les frais que le dit détenteur doit assumer sur ses permis. Je pense immédiatement à un rabais qui pourrait avantager les gros joueurs, et entrainer une consolidation dans un marché où il y a déjà très peu de compétition. Encore ici, Téo est probablement un des gros joueurs qui pourraient être visé par cette disposition.\\n\\n<strong>Articles 37 &amp; 38</strong>\\n<blockquote>« 117.

Cette définition laisse encore trop de place aux abus de zèle de la part des policiers: l'intention est sujette à interpretation, et la limite des contributions sous-entends encore que de faire un peu d'argent pour services rendus est inacceptable.

Un client pourra-t'il profiter de meilleurs tarifs si il utiliser une application pour commander son taxi, et inversement, cette disposition ouvre-t'elle la porte à une surcharge pour les appels au &quot;dispatchs&quot; téléphoniques?

Sometimes, you just want to fire up a machine, open a file you've been working on from your desktop and put in some work, without thinking about it.

I was completely kidding myself when I thought I would be making savings by going to a less powerful machine, and I've got several Us of rackspace to show for it. The real challenge isn't really saving money, it's integrating the hardware in a way which sticks to this idea of a single terminal to rule them all. Steam's addition of <a href=\\\"http://store.steampowered.com/streaming/\\\">In-Home streaming functionality</a> is great for providing gaming in this way. Here's my experience with getting the thing to run correctly.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<strong>My setup</strong>\\n\\nAs with any gaming setup, the sky is the limit as to what you build to use In-Home Streaming. My setup is relatively humble, a far cry from the flashy (and noisy, and expensive) rigs I was building before. Here are the specs.\\n\\n<strong>Case:</strong> Cooler Master Elite 110\\n<strong>Power Supply:</strong> Corsair Pro Series AX650\\n<strong>Motherboard:</strong> Asrock H81-M ITX\\n<strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-4790K\\n<strong>Memory:</strong> Crucial Ballistix Sport 16GB\\n<strong>GPU:</strong> Zotax GTX 960 2G\\n\\nThis setup lives in a closet along with my other networking stuff, with only a network cable and a power cable going to it.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<strong>Common problems and fixes</strong>\\n\\nThe Steam KB covers setup and really common problems well, so I'm not going to bother sharing how to get the thing to work. What I will cover though are the problems that I have personally ran into. Most of them are related to running a machine without any input or output peripherals. Depending on how games manage mouse and keyboard output as well as video output, they may not like not having a physical inputs plugged in, or not being passed on a screen resolution by the OS because the screen is absent.\\n\\nThe most obvious need is for an <strong>emulated display</strong>. Being a <a href=\\\"http://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/user_summary.php?s=&amp;u=281903\\\">long-time contributor</a> to the <a href=\\\"https://folding.stanford.edu\\\">Folding@Home project</a>, I was well aware that nothing that uses a GPU would work without either a monitor or a dummy plug. The old-school way of doing this is using the DVI-to-VGA plugs that usually come with graphics cards along with some resistors to cook up a <a href=\\\"http://www.overclock.net/t/384733/the-30-second-dummy-plug\\\">quick and dirty dummy plug</a>; the folding community has used those for years, and they are known to just work. While the internet specifies 68 to 75 ohm resistors to get this working, I've done mine with 125 ohm resistors to the same effect. The new-school way would be to use an HDMI dummy plug, which has the additional advantage of emulating an audio output, which eliminates the need for more dongles and hacks.\\n\\n<strong>Audio also needs to have a simulated output</strong>, because most audio chipsets theses days deactivate if no headphones or speakers are plugged into them. While I'm sure we all have spare sets of broken headphones around, neat freaks will likely want a cleaner solution. Most motherboard 3.5mm audio jacks have physical switches inside, so all you need is to physically stuff either <a href=\\\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10295\\\">a dummy plug</a> or an actual, unwired 3.5mm plug and onboard sound will work. I've personally run into games which crashes and explicitly gave an audio related message. Some games might work, but you're better safe than sorry.\\n\\nFinally, <strong>mouse and keyboard input is also need locally</strong> for remote inputs to work properly. I've played through half of AC4: Blag Flag without the mouse's scroll-wheel because using it would cause the game to infinitely scroll. This is reported to happen in several games by several editors on the Steam forums. Here again, having a mouse plugged in is an easy solution, but not quite as clean as one would want it to be. My solution was to use a Logitech Unifying adaptor, without the wireless mouse or keyboard connected, as it registers as both mouse and keyboard HID devices. It's also very low-profile, which is perfect for this application. I've been looking around to find a way of emulating HID devices via software, but I have not yet found anything worth mentioning. From my time in big box stores, I knew for a fact that my local Geek Squad  would have, for no discernable reason, a buttload of orphaned receivers; that's where I got mine. See with your local store if you don't have a receiver handy. Otherwise, the <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DFPG5CS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=max302-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01DFPG5CS&amp;linkId=5e190445c6c42736a2c385142182c6b2\\\">receivers sell for about 10$ on Amazon</a>.\\n\\nOnce all the inputs and outputs are taken care of, you should have minimized the possibility of games doing weird things on start-up. Then comes the <strong>optimization of the encoding for maximum performance and picture quality</strong>. From the get-go Mac users who have a Nvidia GPU on the backend are SOL when it comes to hardware-accelerated encoding, because of a known incompatibility. The performance is great, but you game will suffer from occasional color spots and artefacts, especially in dark scenes.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/screen-shot-2016-07-25-at-2-19-42-pm1.png\\\"><img class=\\\"size-large wp-image-1107\\\" src=\\\"https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/screen-shot-2016-07-25-at-2-19-42-pm1.png?w=480\\\" alt=\\\"Examples of artefacts and other problems caused by Nvidia encoding when Apple hardware receives it.\\\" width=\\\"480\\\" height=\\\"141\\\" /></a> Examples of artefacts and other problems caused by Nvidia encoding when Apple hardware receives it.\\n\\nFor my setup, I found that simply deactivating hardware encoding altogether makes for the most beautiful and smoothest gameplay. Intel iGPU mights seem like a good idea, because it offloads to hardware thanks to Intel Quick Sync Video, but I found it to be lacking, with the video output being quite laggy despite framerates staying high. I'm not sure that's what Quick Sync Video was meant for; I'd stay away from it. If you have a modern CPU, chances are your bottleneck isn't the CPU anyhow, so software encoding will probably do little to your experience unless you're running a very CPU-intensive title. Steam forum posts seem to mirror my experience.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<strong>Caveats and important considerations</strong>\\n\\nDespite the fact that this system works great for me, there are some things to be aware of. It works for me because I'm a filthy casual, albeit a very tech-enthousiast filthy casual. I only build a computer to play games when I've amassed too many from <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr2GdRBDOmU\\\">Steam Summer Sales</a> to not play them. I've been gaming on wireless peripherals for a few years now, and I'm not going back. I don't care too much about latencies, refresh rates and the like. If you're a hardcore gamer, you probably hate the idea of streaming a game, because MUH LATENCY. If you're a filthy casual of the non-IT aficionado variety, I'm surprised you're still reading this. This brings me to what is probably the biggest caveat of In-Home Streaming: I feel like it doesn't fit too many use cases yet, for a variety of reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, <strong>you need fast networking</strong>. I'm talking wired, ideally gigabit if you want your games to run smoothly. Since most normie non-gamers' idea of fast networking is likely router with \\\"Wireless AC\\\" written on it, it's probably not gonna work for most folks. The convenience of wifi has long overtaken good old cables, and it's a hard sell to ask users to drop the convenience and run cables.\\n\\nSecondly, <strong>it's not like gaming in front an actual display</strong> in terms of imagine quality. The video stream coming from the rendering side of the setup is compressed, and those of you with keen eyes will notice this in certain settings, especially if you're running on a non-gigabit connection.\\n\\nThirdly, <strong>it's still not seamless</strong>. Most games will work fine, even the ones that require a launcher or aren't from Steam, but some titles inexplicably require some user intervention via RDP to get things to work. For example, after launching Watch Dogs, other Steam-enabled Ubisoft titles will no longer launch some times, requiring a restart of Uplay. Sticking to the same title is fine, but playing different ones will inevitable at some point cause hiccups which will require user intervention. It's never something major, but it's still a pain in the butt.\\n\\nFinally, <strong>there is some of the dreaded additional latency,</strong> on input and display. You won't be winning a CS:GO world championship on a stream of a remote computer. It's only really noticeable on faster shooters, but it's there, by the very nature of how it works. As video codecs get better and 10BaseT becomes ubiquitous, we'll see this concern fading away, but for now we have to deal with it.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\\n\\nTo sum it all up, while I don't think the technology is quite mainstream ready, Steam's In-Home Streaming is a step in what I see as the way of the future, that is decoupling a computing/gaming experience from the hardware required to provide it. Let's face it, if you're building your own computer, you probably can handle the additional legwork of configuring and maintaining a streaming box. If on top of that you don't mind making minor concessions on performance for the sake praticality, I'd strongly recommend you look into it. For my, having a totally silent work environment alone is well worth it.\\n\\nIn part 2, I'll go over what I'd like my next Steaming box to look like, and what steps I intend to take to integrate In-Home Streaming functionality to my existing server setup.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>For almost exactly three years now, I've been using a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/sp678?locale=en_US\">mid-2013 13.3&quot; Macbook Air</a> as my primary machine.

I was completely kidding myself when I thought I would be making savings by going to a less powerful machine, and I've got several Us of rackspace to show for it. The real challenge isn't really saving money, it's integrating the hardware in a way which sticks to this idea of a single terminal to rule them all. Steam's addition of <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/streaming/\">In-Home streaming functionality</a> is great for providing gaming in this way. Here's my experience with getting the thing to run correctly.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>My setup</strong></p>\n<p>As with any gaming setup, the sky is the limit as to what you build to use In-Home Streaming. My setup is relatively humble, a far cry from the flashy (and noisy, and expensive) rigs I was building before. Here are the specs.</p>\n<p><strong>Case:</strong> Cooler Master Elite 110<br>\n<strong>Power Supply:</strong> Corsair Pro Series AX650<br>\n<strong>Motherboard:</strong> Asrock H81-M ITX<br>\n<strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-4790K<br>\n<strong>Memory:</strong> Crucial Ballistix Sport 16GB<br>\n<strong>GPU:</strong> Zotax GTX 960 2G</p>\n<p>This setup lives in a closet along with my other networking stuff, with only a network cable and a power cable going to it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Common problems and fixes</strong></p>\n<p>The Steam KB covers setup and really common problems well, so I'm not going to bother sharing how to get the thing to work. What I will cover though are the problems that I have personally ran into. Most of them are related to running a machine without any input or output peripherals. Depending on how games manage mouse and keyboard output as well as video output, they may not like not having a physical inputs plugged in, or not being passed on a screen resolution by the OS because the screen is absent.</p>\n<p>The most obvious need is for an <strong>emulated display</strong>. Being a <a href=\"http://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/user_summary.php?s=&amp;u=281903\">long-time contributor</a> to the <a href=\"https://folding.stanford.edu\">Folding@Home project</a>, I was well aware that nothing that uses a GPU would work without either a monitor or a dummy plug. The old-school way of doing this is using the DVI-to-VGA plugs that usually come with graphics cards along with some resistors to cook up a <a href=\"http://www.overclock.net/t/384733/the-30-second-dummy-plug\">quick and dirty dummy plug</a>; the folding community has used those for years, and they are known to just work. While the internet specifies 68 to 75 ohm resistors to get this working, I've done mine with 125 ohm resistors to the same effect. The new-school way would be to use an HDMI dummy plug, which has the additional advantage of emulating an audio output, which eliminates the need for more dongles and hacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Audio also needs to have a simulated output</strong>, because most audio chipsets theses days deactivate if no headphones or speakers are plugged into them. While I'm sure we all have spare sets of broken headphones around, neat freaks will likely want a cleaner solution. Most motherboard 3.5mm audio jacks have physical switches inside, so all you need is to physically stuff either <a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10295\">a dummy plug</a> or an actual, unwired 3.5mm plug and onboard sound will work. I've personally run into games which crashes and explicitly gave an audio related message. Some games might work, but you're better safe than sorry.</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>mouse and keyboard input is also need locally</strong> for remote inputs to work properly. I've played through half of AC4: Blag Flag without the mouse's scroll-wheel because using it would cause the game to infinitely scroll. This is reported to happen in several games by several editors on the Steam forums. Here again, having a mouse plugged in is an easy solution, but not quite as clean as one would want it to be. My solution was to use a Logitech Unifying adaptor, without the wireless mouse or keyboard connected, as it registers as both mouse and keyboard HID devices. It's also very low-profile, which is perfect for this application. I've been looking around to find a way of emulating HID devices via software, but I have not yet found anything worth mentioning. From my time in big box stores, I knew for a fact that my local Geek Squad  would have, for no discernable reason, a buttload of orphaned receivers; that's where I got mine. See with your local store if you don't have a receiver handy. Otherwise, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DFPG5CS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=max302-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01DFPG5CS&amp;linkId=5e190445c6c42736a2c385142182c6b2\">receivers sell for about 10$ on Amazon</a>.</p>\n<p>Once all the inputs and outputs are taken care of, you should have minimized the possibility of games doing weird things on start-up. Then comes the <strong>optimization of the encoding for maximum performance and picture quality</strong>.

If you try to bypass it, then don't hope to get any kind of technical support: the mindless automatons that they haven't managed to outsource or replace with machines at their level one support will absolutely refuse to escalate your call or provide any sort of useful information. The Sagemcom has a bridge modem that can be triggered with button presses: if it's bridging, they also won't be supporting it.

Basically, traffic to the Bell ONT is divided into two VLANs, 35 for the internet traffic and 36 for the Fibe TV streams. Our use case only had an internet connection, so getting it to work was as simple as creating a VLAN interface on ethernet interface we used to connect to the Alcatel Lucent ONT, and creating a PPPOE interfaces within this VLAN. Once that's done, enter your username and password for the PPP connection as provided by Bell, set the firewall rules for your connection and you're good to go. The commands should look like this:\\n<blockquote><strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35</strong>\\n<em>     #creates VLAN 35 on interfaces ethX</em>\\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0</strong>\\n<em>     #creates PPPOE connection zero within the newly created VLAN</em>\\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 username thisisyourusername@bellnet.ca</strong>\\n<em>     #self-explanatory</em>\\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 password thisisyourpassword</strong>\\n<em>     #ditto</em>\\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 firewall in name WAN_IN</strong>\\n<em>     #set firewall inbound firewall rules</em>\\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 firewall local name WAN_LOCAL</strong>\\n<em>     #set firewall local rules</em>\\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 default-route auto</strong>\\n<em>     #get your routes from your PPPOE connection</em></blockquote>\\nBy default, your Edgerouter uses all the right options for connection to PPPOE properly, except for one.

Basically, traffic to the Bell ONT is divided into two VLANs, 35 for the internet traffic and 36 for the Fibe TV streams. Our use case only had an internet connection, so getting it to work was as simple as creating a VLAN interface on ethernet interface we used to connect to the Alcatel Lucent ONT, and creating a PPPOE interfaces within this VLAN. Once that's done, enter your username and password for the PPP connection as provided by Bell, set the firewall rules for your connection and you're good to go. The commands should look like this:</p>\n<blockquote><strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35</strong>\n<em>     #creates VLAN 35 on interfaces ethX</em>\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0</strong>\n<em>     #creates PPPOE connection zero within the newly created VLAN</em>\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 username thisisyourusername@bellnet.ca</strong>\n<em>     #self-explanatory</em>\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 password thisisyourpassword</strong>\n<em>     #ditto</em>\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 firewall in name WAN_IN</strong>\n<em>     #set firewall inbound firewall rules</em>\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 firewall local name WAN_LOCAL</strong>\n<em>     #set firewall local rules</em>\n<strong>set interfaces ethernet ethX vif 35 pppoe 0 default-route auto</strong>\n<em>     #get your routes from your PPPOE connection</em></blockquote>\nBy default, your Edgerouter uses all the right options for connection to PPPOE properly, except for one.

The concept has been pushed way past the borders of absurdity, as highlighted by the likes of <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/internetofshit\\\">@InternetofShit</a>. I'm only half surprised: personal computing has plateaued, with many of the \\\"traditional\\\" challenges posed by hardware such as transistor and storage density being more of less solved, what more is there to innovate in? To break the \\\"sit down in front of a screen\\\" paradigm of computing, the industry is shooting in all directions to find new ground. This spray-and-pray approach to innovation is surely finding new ways to do things, but in the frenzy of it, we are offered truly senseless gadgets, from <a href=\\\"http://gizmodo.com/the-worlds-first-smart-candle-can-be-lit-and-extinguish-1786637893\\\">cloud-connected candles</a> to <a href=\\\"https://www.intimina.com/en/kegelsmart\\\">bluetooth kegel exercisers</a>.\\n\\nAll these gadgets are of course intended to be mass-marketed to the public at large, people who are in the aggregate are almost completely technologically illiterate. I'd bet that most of the time, they are used with whatever app they are shipped with, and seldom integrated into other systems through platforms like IFTTT. Because they have to just work even for the least tech savvy, several shortcuts are taken in the design of these gadgets: more often than not they are battery powered, and work in a way which handicaps their usability for more advanced user. They are almost never meant to have a lifetime that exceeds a few years, at most. Almost all the time, they are dependant on some online service running in the cloud, which is susceptible to be hacked, taken down due to an outage, or just plain shut down when the gadget-maker inevitably goes bankrupt or disappears in the fog like so many other tech companies.\\n\\nAll the while this is happening, people buying the gadgets with the intent of having technology make their lives easier are connecting all those devices to 50$ routers which are generally both unreliable and insecure. They pipe enormous amounts of data, some of it sensitive in nature, to servers hosted who knows where. Home automation is on everybody's lips, but houses are still being built with a basic run of RG6 and a few phone lines as the only data cables present within their walls. Technology as a whole is ubiquitous, but no one technology has gained the traction necessary to signal a significant change; one might have a smart lock and the other a few smart lights, but only the biggest nerds have integrated these things into systems which ACTUALLY make day-to-day living easier or more enjoyable. Absolutely none of these piece-meal IoT innovations has had the impact on the population at large of, say, the electric refrigerator or the good old personal computer. I believe the IoT will remain but a buzzword until the industry leaps over this hurdle and brings forth something that becomes as widespread in it's adoption.\\n\\nI feel that home automation is the place where the IoT really has the potential to shine. It's completely abhorrent that technology we use to interface with the functionalities of our living spaces have been largely unchanged for the past century. With the current concern for making dwellings more energy efficient, I think the time is ripe for more widespread adoption, but certain things have to change. I believe that for IoT to gain traction, particularly in the home automation sphere, certain things need to change; some things need to stop, and others need to start happening more often.\\n\\n<b>STOP MAKING YOUR DEVICE RELIANT ON THE CLOUD. </b>Off-loading compute and management to the cloud is a smart thing to do, for all sorts of reasons which I won't bother listing. Most users don't mind sending massive amounts of data to the cloud, and those that do are generally the type of people to homebrew their own automation solutions, so privacy concerns are not a huge deal. Where relying on the cloud gets annoying is when it, or your access to it, fails. The <a href=\\\"http://gizmodo.com/internet-connected-pet-feeder-goes-offline-pets-probab-1784480694\\\">PetNet fiasco</a> is a good example of this. It's horribly bad design to rely on inputs from the internet to have things work, and even in 2016, nobody should ever be assumed to have a 100% uptime internet connection.

For Unifi gear, everything needs to talk back to the controller for your network to work, and if that controller is local, you'll need to punch a few holes in your firewall. More on this later.\\n\\n<span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\"><strong>Network management:</strong></span> This is for the administration interfaces of switches, routers and access points, in addition to IPMI and other remote KVM options. In a Unifi environment, nobody should be talking to the APs or the switch, so can normally be isolation. A per-host exceptions can be made if you want to access those devices, most likely an IPMI console, with your main machine. Seeing that IPMI practically gives the next best thing to physical access to your systems and <a href=\\\"https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/07/02/a-penetration-testers-guide-to-ipmi\\\">has been proven to be a wide-open opportunity for attack</a>, it stands to reason to reason that this segment should be as strongly sealed up through your firewall policy.

Let me know if I missed anything.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"597410b7a24d2481eac7af42","plaintext":"I've been putting off segmenting my network for a while now, but the recent IoT\nbotnet powered DDoS has bumped the task up my list of priorities, and I finally\ngot around to doing it. Generally, if your network is anything other than\nnon-critical clients accessing the internet, that is to say if you have any sort\nof IoT devices or it you host any internet-facing services at home, it's\nprobably a smart thing to split up your network into segments. Doing so allows\nfiner-grained control over which machines can talk to each other, thus enhancing\nsecurity. A segmented network is usually also easier to survey and audit,\nbecause irregularities like \"why the hell is there an Acer laptop in my server\nsegment?\" stand out more, and with the appropriate monitoring solutions you can\nmore easily generate usage stats by just running queries for an entire segment.\n\nLet's use the IoT botnet situation as a practical example. If your chinese-made,\noff-brand IP camera system was rooted, we now know that it has the potential to\ntake part in taking down a third of the internet. But being that a third party\nhas complete control over the device, there's no telling what what it could do,\nincluding spread to other machines on your network, steal some files off an\nimproperly secured network share, etc. Not being able to shitpost to Facebook is\none thing, but messing around with my self-hosted stuff and data is where I draw\nthe line.\n\n\n\nThere exists several models for how to segment networks, but this is one of\nthose things that is really an exercise in common sense. A military buddy once\nevoked a three tier system that's the standard for military IP networks; that's\nprobably great for their use case, but your home isn't a forward operating base\nin the horn of Africa, and the military probably doesn't have the likes of Nests\nand Augusts in their networks. Thanks to the magic of VLANs, you aren't bound to\na specific number of segments, and you're probably better off doing more than\nnot enough, within reason. Here's what my setup looks like.\n[https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/apptwifi.png]\n\n[https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/homenet.png]It's a pretty\nsimple setup, but since the pictures are not really representative, here's some\nmore explanation.\n\nGeneral access: This is the untagged network that anybody who connects via wifi\nor wired connection gets assigned to without further configuration. This is the\nleast trusted segment, in that it has limited access to the others, but it's\nalso protected from the other segments.\n\nWeb-facing services: Self-explanatory. This is completely isolated from all the\nother segments, both in and out, because clients who normally just connect\nthrough WAN. There is an exception for local clients trying to connect from \nGeneral access and Network managment segments, which get NAT'd back in, but\nthose exceptions are made for application specific ports only and everything\nelse can be firewalled out. For Unifi gear, everything needs to talk back to the\ncontroller for your network to work, and if that controller is local, you'll\nneed to punch a few holes in your firewall. More on this later.\n\nNetwork management: This is for the administration interfaces of switches,\nrouters and access points, in addition to IPMI and other remote KVM options. In\na Unifi environment, nobody should be talking to the APs or the switch, so can\nnormally be isolation. A per-host exceptions can be made if you want to access\nthose devices, most likely an IPMI console, with your main machine. Seeing that\nIPMI practically gives the next best thing to physical access to your systems\nand has been proven to be a wide-open opportunity for attack\n[https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/07/02/a-penetration-testers-guide-to-ipmi]\n, it stands to reason to reason that this segment should be as strongly sealed\nup through your firewall policy. Note that for now, Unifi APs do not support\nbeing managed on a tagged VLAN, although the feature is supposed to be in the\nworks\n[https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Feature-Requests/Allow-management-traffic-to-be-tagged-to-specific-VLAN/idc-p/591285#M108]\n. My own Unifi switch did not have this problem with the latest firmware.\n\nHome Automation: Since home automation products usually only talk to the\ninternet anyways\n[https://maximerousseau.com/2016/10/18/the-internet-of-things-needs-integrators-not-gadgets/]\n, this is another locked-down segment that can't speak to anybody. Where\nnecessary, an appliance that needs access to more \"commercial-grade\" products\nthat actually allow interaction from the LAN can be assigned an address within\nthe VLAN. While it's not deployed right now, a virtualized machine running Home\nAssistant [https://home-assistant.io] would be interesting.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBuilding a segmented network with a Unifi gateway as your router is a bit\ndifferent from what could be done on other platforms, since the incomplete GUI\ncontrols don't offer all the options necessary to fine-tuning your setup. The\nmajor annoyance is that NAT loopback (aka hairpin or reflection) doesn't seem to\nbe properly implemented. Port-forwarding via the USG configuration menu works\nwhen accessing from the internet, but loopback config seems to assume that you\nwill only be forwarding ports to a single subnet, and hence only need\nloopback to and from this subnet. We'll need to fix this.\n\n[https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-04-at-3-06-58-pm.png]\nI found the fix for this while reading a date how-to for EdgeMAX products\n[https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/204952134-EdgeMAX-NAT-Hairpin-Nat-Inside-to-Inside-Loopback-Reflection-]\n. Once you've configured your port forwards, you'll have to manually setup NAT\nmasquerading to the hosts that will be receiving the forwards for loopback to\nfunction correctly. There are no means of settings these things up in the GUI,\nso you'll have to use the old config.gateway.json trick to manually input\n[https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-How-to-further-customize-USG-configuration-with-config-gateway-json] \nsome NAT rules.\n\nI strongly recommend learning how to program Edgemax / Unifi gear, because it's\ngreat help in understanding how to modify the config file, but in case you're in\na hurry, here's a sample of the JSON you'll need to add.\n\n \n{\n     \"service\": {\n          \"nat\": {\n               \"rule\": {\n                    \"7001\": {\n                         \"description\": \"Hairpin NAT Transmission\",\n                         \"destination\": {\n                               \"address\": \"10.1.2.3\",\n                               \"port\": \"9091\"\n                         },\n                         \"log\": \"disable\",\n                         \"outbound-interface\": \"eth1.121\",\n                         \"protocol\": \"tcp\",\n                         \"source\": {\n                               \"address\": \"10.1.0.0/24\"\n                         },\n                        \"type\": \"masquerade\"\n                    }\n               }\n          }\n     }\n}\n\nReplace the description, destination address and port, source address range,\noutbound interface (mind the VLAN!) and you are good to go. You will need one\nrule for every host. This JSON was built assuming you have nothing in your\non-controller config file, do respect the hierarchy if you have other things\ngoing on in there, and ALWAYS validate your code [http://jsonlint.com].\n\nYou'll need a rule for every port forward you want accessible from your LAN. It\nmight be possible to define those in one shot by defining several destination\naddresses and ports, but I have't tested this.\n\nIn the event that the destination port on your forward is not identical to the\nincoming port, you'll want to configure the inside port in this masquerade for\nit to work. Be careful, loopback traffic is not exempt from passing through your\nLAN-IN firewall rules, so you'll need to configure exemptions to let that\nthrough.\n\n[https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-04-at-10-16-35-pm.png]\nThis is what my LAN-IN firewall config looks like. Note the exemptions: 1) for\nNAT loopbacks, 2) for packets coming back on active connections to services\navailable through loopback connections and 3) for the switch on the management\nsegment, which still needs to talk to the controller which has not yet been\nmigrated from my general access segment. Rule 2004 is disabled for the same\nreason.\n\n[https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-04-at-3-46-48-pm.png]\nThe content of Web-Service-Loopbacks group. Note that I used hosts, not the\nentire segment, which would negate my isolation rules.\n\nThat's it!

To carry on with the transportation example, it appears self-evident that there are more than enough road-going vehicles currently in North-American to satisfy the entire aggregate demand for transportation, if only we had a means of extracting all this dormant value.

On the efficiency side of things, having millions of customers on the same ultra-robust infrastructure and enabling nearly automated scale-out makes sense, but in the aggregate, people who want or need their own hardware will continue to build for peak load.

Turns out, that’s already in the works, at least with storage: enter <a href=\\\"https://app.storj.io/#/signup?referralLink=peep-tasty-554\\\">Storj</a>.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/storj_io-logo.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1186\\\" src=\\\"https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/storj_io-logo.png?w=295\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"295\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a>\\n\\nThe Storj project uses blockchain technology to build a network of storage nodes which store data in a way that makes it fast, resilient and efficient. Users with spare storage and bandwidth can assign a certain quantity of hard drive space to be shared on the network, which is advertised via DHT, the same technology that enables trackerless bittorrent downloads, and loaned out through smart contracts to people or businesses who need their files hosted. The protocol manages redundancy, and has provisions for determining which blocs (or shards) go where based on parameters like availability, and speed of the hosting node. The network has been shown to be pretty fast, to the point where you can <a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/154743500\\\">stream media from it</a>. Based on how much data you make available on the network, how much discrete contracts your node services and how well it does it, you get paid in a special <a href=\\\"https://poloniex.com/exchange#BTC_SJCX\\\">crypto token</a> that can be redeemed for other crypto and fiat. At scale, this token can also be used to pay for services, giving it real world value which makes it an interesting digital asset to hold.\\n\\nThe first use case that comes to mind is a Dropbox-like service with lower cost per gigabyte and greater fault-tolerance (and possibly greater speed), but this is not what the Storj team is pursuing, choosing instead to focus on being a backend for other app builders and service providers. This is a smart choice, because the technology opens up incredible opportunities in networks that already exist, but rely on a more traditional server-client architecture. For one, anything that relies on a content distribution network (CDN) could benefit from this technology, in reducing the need for robust server infrastructure to serve content directly, giving redundant access to storage, and possibly reducing the cost of actually getting data from point A to point B. Consider an IP-based TV service provider of the traditional kind, which still puts receivers in it’s customers’ homes. With private Storj network, it could leverage the thousands of unfilled hard drives in it’s receivers to store on-demand content, radically decreasing it’s need for servers and stress on the main trunks of it’s infrastructure. If two neighbourhoods’ worth of receiver hard drives can store all of it’s on-demand content, why overbuild the link from theses two neighborhood to it’s datacenters hundreds of kilometers away? This way of doing things essentially spreads out the load on storage and network over a wider area, making a more efficient use of what resources are already in it.\\n\\nThere have been other tries at distributed storage before. I’ve been involved in using <a href=\\\"https://www.resilio.com\\\">Resilio</a>, formerly known as BitTorrent Sync, in a fairly large production environment to transfer content, and it worked pretty well, but was intended to sync between your own nodes, not necessarily the network at large, making it less interesting in terms of it’s ability to spread the load. <a href=\\\"https://syncthing.net\\\">Syncthing</a> offers more or the less the same feature-set as Resilio, is open-souce and cross-platform, but suffers the same drawback of being aimed at providing file-sharing between nodes you operate yourself. None of these solutions do anything to utilize dormant resources, let alone remunerate you for contributing to the network. To put it otherwise, existing solutions are still within the traditional \\\"cloud\\\" paradigm of specialized machines doing particular jobs, wheres Storj goes way beyond that into the distributed cloud.\\n\\nIf you have spare storage, and chances are that if you live in the developed world you most probably do, I strongly suggest that you encourage the project and download their app and start sharing. The project currently has several petabytes (a million gigbytes) of available storage, making it probably the biggest experiment in distributed storage to ever have existed. With important commercial agreements having recently kicked in, the product being out of beta, and paid access billing systems now fully functional, the network is surely going to see a spike of activity. You’ll be making money off storage you otherwise wouldn’t use, but you’d also be contributing in technology that will surely power power the internet of tomorrow. <a href=\\\"https://storj.io/share.html\\\">The sharing page has everything you need to become a data farmer</a>.\\n\\nProjets like these show what the sharing economy is really about.

It's not really about sharing in the altruistic sense, it's about using technology to break down barriers to entry and making markets work better, decentralizing all the things, and empowering consumers by promoting them to the status of producer.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"597410b7a24d2481eac7af43","plaintext":"The sharing economy is a buzzword which has gained enormous traction despite the\nfact that it remains misunderstood, in my opinion. The luddite politicians who\nhave been vocal against it on the grounds that it’s a dishonest loophole for\nescaping regulatory frameworks have it obviously wrong, but I feel that even\nenthusiastic participants and users probably haven’t considered all it’s\nimplications. It’s not just about creating internet marketplaces for everything.\nThe true genius of the sharing economy is twofold.\n\nFirst, it creates producers out of what would have been previously considered\nordinary consumers. This in itself is an incredible thing which holds the\npromise of economic emancipation for a segment of the population who were\npreviously unable to jump over the barrier to entry and start making money out\nof their property. Ordinary folks traditionally have had to buy productive goods\nand watch them depreciate before their eyes while they made limited use of it.\nThe car is probably the best example of this: it’s an expensive piece of\nmachinery that people pay to own, pay to use, pay to upkeep and often pay to\nstore. It’s an expense, not an investment, because it simply can’t generate\nenough value in the hands of a single individual. Uber\n[https://www.uber.com/invite/maximer1] and Turo\n[https://turo.com/referral?code=2412490rc875B] have changed this, and though a\nwebsite have transformed thousands of cars from consumer goods to capital goods.\nIn the Marxist sense, people now literally own means of productions.\n\nSecondly, and this is closely related to the first point, the sharing economy\nenables optimal use of resources, which produces economic efficiency. Because\neconomic efficiency means extracting every last bit of value out of every\nresource, be it goods like cars or consumables like energy, it should be\nchampioned. It’s good for the economy, good for the environment, and by lowering\nthe cost of certain goods and services, it’s also a social good. To carry on\nwith the transportation example, it appears self-evident that there are more\nthan enough road-going vehicles currently in North-American to satisfy the\nentire aggregate demand for transportation, if only we had a means of extracting\nall this dormant value. The sharing economy is this means.\n\nInformation technology has allowed the sharing economy, but it could also\ngreatly profit from it. The turn to cloud-based server infrastructure is great,\nbecause it allows for cost-efficient and resilient systems that are easy to\nscale out, but the true cloud hasn’t yet been achieved. The “cloud” still lives\nin servers and cabinets which are centralized in server rooms and datacenters,\nand no amount of local redundancy will rid this model of it’s vulnerabilities to\ndowntime. In essence, it's really just somebody elses computer(s). Like it or\nnot, AWS still suffers from outages\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/amazon-aws-s3-outage-is-breaking-things-for-a-lot-of-websites-and-apps/]\n. On the efficiency side of things, having millions of customers on the same\nultra-robust infrastructure and enabling nearly automated scale-out makes sense,\nbut in the aggregate, people who want or need their own hardware will continue\nto build for peak load. This means that a lot of compute, storage and network\ncapacity is wasted while servers wait idly for sufficient solicitation. That’s\nfor servers, but imagine the compute lost in ordinary desktop computers that are\nalways powered on across the world, only to be used to browse Facebook a couple\nof hours a week.\n\nThe next step in achieving in achieving a connected world is decentralizing\ncompute and storage, making the internet truly everything-proof short of a\nnuclear apocalypse. Here again, as with the transportation problem, it can\neasily be imagined that this utopia could be achieve if the available compute\nand storage resources lying dormant could be utilized fully. Turns out, that’s\nalready in the works, at least with storage: enter Storj\n[https://app.storj.io/#/signup?referralLink=peep-tasty-554].\n\n [https://maximerousseau.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/storj_io-logo.png]\n\nThe Storj project uses blockchain technology to build a network of storage nodes\nwhich store data in a way that makes it fast, resilient and efficient. Users\nwith spare storage and bandwidth can assign a certain quantity of hard drive\nspace to be shared on the network, which is advertised via DHT, the same\ntechnology that enables trackerless bittorrent downloads, and loaned out through\nsmart contracts to people or businesses who need their files hosted. The\nprotocol manages redundancy, and has provisions for determining which blocs (or\nshards) go where based on parameters like availability, and speed of the hosting\nnode. The network has been shown to be pretty fast, to the point where you can \nstream media from it [https://vimeo.com/154743500]. Based on how much data you\nmake available on the network, how much discrete contracts your node services\nand how well it does it, you get paid in a special crypto token\n[https://poloniex.com/exchange#BTC_SJCX]that can be redeemed for other crypto\nand fiat. At scale, this token can also be used to pay for services, giving it\nreal world value which makes it an interesting digital asset to hold.\n\nThe first use case that comes to mind is a Dropbox-like service with lower cost\nper gigabyte and greater fault-tolerance (and possibly greater speed), but this\nis not what the Storj team is pursuing, choosing instead to focus on being a\nbackend for other app builders and service providers.

In an age of Facebook meme wars, niche\nideologies have found spaces to grow their following, at the cost of becoming\necho-chambers reinforced by content-curation algorithms. Online, compromise is\neasily recognized as weakness, and granting a point to an opponent is grounds to\nbe considered either defeated or treasonous. Purists have little to lose if not\ntheir spare time in defending ideological zealotry, and the impersonal\ninteractions through text make discarding inconvenient rebuttals too easy. In\nreal-life institutionalized politics, hardliners lose. First and foremost for\nthe obvious reason that fringe groups never have the mass appeal to set the\npolitical agenda. Secondly because real-world discussions and debates are rarely\n100% oppositional and require common ground, which both parties are incentivized\nto recognize, lest they sound unreasonable to the masses. Thirdly because\npolitics is a messy power-struggle, one in which even the best of plans always\nget sidetracked.\n\nDespite the idealism that Don shows through his blog posts throughout the novel,\nthe series of events surrounding the pursuit of Free Dakota follows a much more\nsinuous path. This paths seems to suggest the inevitable fallibility of \"pure\"\nlibertarianism or anarcho-capitalism, showing some sort of ultra-minimal\ngovernment as a more likely outcome of a libertarian revolution. In his prior\nwork which I reviewed\n[https://maximerousseau.com/2016/05/19/the-free-market-existentialist-review-and-musings/]\n, Irwin manifested a decidedly minarchist conception of libertarianism, so this\ncomes at no surprise. While it might fall short of pressing all the feel-good\nbuttons of convinced Libertarians, I think that avoiding the trap of describing\na utopia sends out a more convincing message to fence-sitters: tasting the fruit\nof freedom will come at a price.\n\nBeing a political scientist from Quebec, the subject of separatism and\nsovereignty certain struck a cord, but not for the reasons you might expect.\nHere in Quebec, popular support for state-led cultural imperialism and statism\nfor nationalistic ends is precisely what allows repressive policies, a situation\nhardly comparable with the Free Dakota movement in Irwin's book. For American\nlibertarians and constitutionalists who see their federal government as Goliath\nand states as their David, this story will surely resonate. It's the story of\nthe revolution all again, the little folk sticking it to the proverbial man in\nsearch of liberty. I kept seeing the negative: the imperfection of the pursuit\nof sovereignty at a smaller scale which still impedes on the ultimate\nsovereignty, that of the individual. The referendum for Free Dakota passes, but\nwhat of the voters who did not consent to secession? They are victims of\nmob-rule democracy just like libertarians feel they are now. The story doesn't\nsay what happens to them. The situation is imperfect, but that's precisely the\npoint, I think: since we are condemned to choose, in life as in politics, we\nmight as well give ourselves as many options as possible. Secession and the\nfounding of Free Dakota isn't a perfect end in itself, but rather another\npolitical option, a way to opt-out of lesser options. Here again, but idea of\ncompromise and the lesser of evils is very present.\n\nIf I'm perfectly honest, this is probably not a book I would have picked up for\na pleasurable read: the normative charge is apparent from very early on, and\nDon's ramblings with himself, on his blog and in dialogue are sometimes a bore\nif what you're looking in a novel is escapism. Despite the fact that they lay\ndown ground rules that might be helpful for initiates, it does distract from the\nplot and upset the book's balance. This didn't pose enough of a problem to keep\nme from reading the book in one sitting however. At under 200 relatively light\npages, it's an easy read, something I'd feel comfortable putting in anybody's\nhands as a primer to libertarian thinking. As Irwin's first effort in fiction, I\nthink the result is good, and I'm eager to read more of his output: practice\nmakes perfect.\n\nYou can buy Free Dakota from Amazon\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1785353268/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1785353268&linkCode=as2&tag=max302-20&linkId=f88b0ae8b6eebba7c2a51b3315fb7c23]\n, and I also recommend that you check out Dr. Irwin's recent commentary on\nBrexit [https://beinglibertarian.com/can-brexit-cant-texit/] which ties the\nevent in with the content of the book.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2016-07-10 01:59:10","updated_at":"2016-07-10 01:59:10","published_at":"2016-07-10 01:59:10","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e4243","uuid":"d8b41cd6-eba3-42c6-aa82-8e39ca69ab54","title":"Piknic Electronik: Dorobo, Appleblim, Addison Groove & Scuba aka SCB","slug":"piknic-electronik-dorobo-appleblim-addison-groove-scuba-aka-scb","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I've been talking about going to the Picnik for many years, but last Sunday I walked the walk: I attended August 14th 2011's edition of the <a href=\\\"http://piknicelectronik.com/en/\\\">Piknic</a>, which feature artists primarily from the UK: Dorobo (Canada), Appleblim, Addison Groove, and Hotflush head-honcho Scuba aka SCB. \\n\\nThe journey on bike was long and perilous; after being slowed down by the Gay Pride parade and put off track by the distant bass hits coming from the neighbouring \\\"<a href=\\\"http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/124-Fete_des_enfants_de_Montreal-event.html\\\">Fete des enfants</a>\\\", I arrived at the Ste Helene Island for the show.

Since then, I have tried to apply this lesson in minimalist packing into my daily life. Previously, my packing/carrying habits would function on a cycle of progressive accumulation followed by a frenzy of furious stripping of anything remotely less useful. The ample wallet that I carried allow me to pack as much stuff as I wanted without getting disorganized, until I eventually grew tired of my fat wallet and cleaned it out to make it slimmer. However, no matter how much stuff you take out, you can't make a big wallet smaller than the size it was built to; after a solid 6 months of minimal wallet habits, that's when I felt a need for change. \\n\\nI had been eyeing <a href=\\\"http://us.bellroy.com/\\\">Bellroy</a>'s stuff for a little while now, as for the past year or so I've been an occasional lurker on their sister site <a href=\\\"http://www.carryology.com/\\\">Carryology</a>, which covers all things carry from wallets to luggage. Seeing a company run a blog featuring mostly competitor's products really inspired me.

Choosing the color was the hard part: I'm a black leather kind of man, but the blue stitching on the black leather seemed kind of out of my usual \\\"shades of gray\\\" color palette, and the tan version also looked very good.

My slim sleeve was unaffected by shipping, and nearly all the packaging that was used to get it from Bellroy to my doorstep could be recycled. \\n\\nMy first contact with my new Slim Sleeve a very pleasant experience. Leather goods in general are very satisfying things to hold and manipulate, so coupled with the \\\"new item\\\" hype, this wallet definitely had me stoked. My particular copy was nearly perfect: the smooth, fine-grained leather was evenly tanned and free of any major defects or flaw. Of course, there were the odd imperfections that give real leather it's character, but otherwise the wallet was a blank canvas for the abuse that I will be putting it through in the years to come. The lining was also in perfect condition, and the sewing was top notch, with every seam tight and laser-straight.The embossed Bellroy logo, which turned out much smaller than I had imagined it, is a nice subtle touch that beautifully completes the clean look of the product. A similar embossed owl logo can be found on the inside of the wallet. Put shortly, the Slim Sleeve looks and feels like a quality product design to stand through years of use.

The design is totally different from the classic note section + card slots, being comprised of two main card slots, a cash/card section and an additional card section with a pull tab. This design is what permits having such a slim wallet: the wallet doesn't control your organization with individual cards slots, note sections, and other features that boil down to useless additional leather, YOU choose where your stuff belongs. \\n\\nIf you're used to regular bi-folds or tri-folds, there will be some things to get used to.

Aussies have it easy with the Slim Sleeve: they can fold their baby-sized notes in half and just slip it right in to the pocket built to that effect. Us Canadians, with our (relatively) big notes, have to be a bit more strategic and fold the notes in three to make them fit, as folding in two will obstruct the fold of the wallet. For obvious reasons, this makes carrying large amounts of cash sort of cumbersome. This doesn't really affect me because I only carry solid currency during my nights out for fast payment, but the old-timers of this world who like carrying around 3 month's worth of pay might find this troublesome. Who still pays cash anyways? By the end of next year we'll all be using <a href=\\\"http://www.bitcoin.org/\\\">bitcoins</a> anyways, right? For the time being, I have found that carrying 6 bills folded in three is perfectly feasable without bulking up the wallet, and I'd expect up to 10 notes to fit without a problem.

Every track gets\na generous serving of heart-searingly emotional vocals, which further adds to\nthe confusion.\n\nI'm not going to review the entire song by song; I'm lightyears away from being\na music critic and I'd rather leave that kind of job to people who have the\nvocabulary and musical knowledge to do a good job of it. What I will do,\nhowever, is clumsily try to give you my overall impression of the album. All in\nall, SBTRKT's debut is amazingly fresh through the wide range of genres that it\nmanages to cram in a single, continuous album that conserves a distinctive feel.\nFurthermore, the vocal elements present throughout gives it a character that\nstraight-up electronic dance floor destroyers lack, no matter how good.\nElectronic music has failed numerous times at integrating voice as a tool for\nconveying emotion (recent proof [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE-dwpWpscU]),\nhowever this album is clearly an exception with Sampha & Little Dragon laying\ndown lyrics with a fragile, smooth tone that isn't corny or cheesy in any way.\n\nThere truly is something for everybody in this album. If you can't enjoy the\ninstrumental aspect of at least one track on this release, then chances are you\nhate electronic music altogether, and if the lyrics were able to touch the most\nhardcore bro-step lovers amongst my friends, then chances are you'll be touched\ntoo. Please, please, don't make this a morning commute type of listening. This\nalbum warrants taking 45 minutes out of your day to find a comfortable seat and\nsome HiFi for a proper listening session: you're in for quite a ride. The last\ntime I've felt so much emotion in synthetic beats was with Zero T's \"Cheap\nShots\", more particularly on Walk Away\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMD7RjWb9qM], and for this reason, I have to say\nthat this release is right up there in my top 5 favourite albums of all time.\n\nCop it now on iTunes [http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/sbtrkt/id440007290].","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5ee9342e5213bf00017e3d48","created_at":"2011-07-11 04:01:20","updated_at":"2011-07-11 04:01:20","published_at":"2011-07-11 04:01:20","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e4247","uuid":"95a10e0f-220e-40cf-9fe3-22ed84dbb65d","title":"Raid-Proof Your FreeNAS with USBKill","slug":"raid-proof-your-freenas-with-usbkill","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"By virtue of being a very multi-functional appliance in most settings, a FreeNAS machine has the potential to be a very sensible part of your rack.

With config file tweaks, you can also run any amount of arbitrary commands and clear swap memory and RAM. \\n\\n## Adapting USBKill to Freenas\\nSince USBKill is comprise of a single file of Python, and officially supports FreeBSD, there were high chances that USBKill would work out of the box with FreeNAS. Unfortunately, FreeNAS does not ship with `lsusb` which is a used by USBKill, so it had to be adapted to use `usbconfig` which does come preinstalled.\\n\\nMy hacked up fork of USBKill for FreeNAS uses parsed output of `usbconfig` to monitor USB peripherals in the same manner as originally intended. \\n\\n **Please note that I have not given any attention to the ram/swap clearing fonctionality. It may or may not work with what is already on board a stock FreeNAS install.**\\n\\nYou can find the [full repo on Github here](https://github.com/max302/usbkill/), but essentially, only the [usbkill.py](https://github.com/max302/usbkill/blob/master/usbkill/usbkill.py) file has been modified. \\n\\n##Setting up USBKill on Freenas\\n\\nWriting to system folders like `/etc/` isn't supported by FreeNAS, any changes will be wiped out on reboot. In order to add stuff to the base OS, you'll need add stuff to `/conf/base/etc`. In my experience, everything within this is upgrade-resistant too, although it's probably a good idea to double-check after major upgrades. Add the necessary files with the following commands: \\n\\n``` mkdir /conf/base/etc/usbkill ```\\n``` cd /conf/base/etc/usbkill ```\\n``` wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max302/usbkill/master/usbkill/usbkill.py ```\\n``` cd /etc/base/etc/ ```\\n``` wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max302/usbkill/master/install/usbkill.ini ```\\n\\nNow, we'll need to have the script start on boot. To do this, we'll pass multiple commands in a one-liner through the [built-in init/shutdown script options](https://doc.freenas.org/9.3/freenas_tasks.html#init-shutdown-scripts). Just add this line once the files have been put in place:\\n\\n``` bash -c 'python /etc/usbkill/usbkill.py > /dev/null 2>&1' &  ```\\n\\nOnce you have save the init command, reboot. Then, you can test functionality by looking for the process we have asked to be launched with `ps -aux | bash`. You'll also get a log at ``` /var/log/usbkill/usbkill.log ``` that has timestamps. If the times line up with your last reboot, it's working.\\n\\nYou'll notice that we're calling on bash, which is an alternate shell on Freenas. This simply makes redirecting output to nul easier; I haven't had great success with csh.\\n\\nHere's a demo on my own FreeNAS system. \\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hej6ycgxWYo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Pre-kill commands\\n\\nDepending on your use case, you might want to run certain pre-kill commands to cause even more grief to whoever is trying to plunder your server. Here are a few ideas: \\n\\n* On an encrypted volume with no passphrase, or even on a volume with a passphrase, you may want to wipe the master AES key and your password encryption secret. These files can be found at `/data/geli/xxxxxxxx.key`and `/data/pwenc_secret` respectively. Deleting the files outright will work, but replacing the data with something plausible yet non-functional can cause even more confusion. \\n* Without completely overwriting your disks, you can also quickly prevent an array from ever remounting by clearing the ZFS metadata. Check [this blog post](https://icesquare.com/wordpress/freebsdhow-to-remove-zfs-meta-data/) to learn how to do this.\\n* Notify yourself. If you mail alerts are correctly configured throught the FreeNAS GUI, using `mail` or `sendmail` to send yourself a notification should be a one line ordeal. \\n* Shutdown everything. Since python is accessible, it's relatively easy to script stuff like IFTTT triggers or basically anything else you can think of. Set your home to lockdown mode, alert friends, mix and empty out your crypto wallets... with a little bit of code, you can do it all.    \\n\\n\\n##FreeNAS-specific additional considerations\\n\\nIn addition to the other [network security measures that I've gone through in this post](https://maximerousseau.com/home-network-segmentation-nat-loopback-to-vlan-on-ubiquiti-unifi-gear/), there are a couple of other things that you can do to protect your install of FreeNAS.\\n\\n* **Disable serial consoles.** Does anybody actually use these things? They constitute an additional attack vector yet provide little to no actual functionality. Disable all serial ports in BIOS. If you still use serial... I don't even know what to tell you. \\n* **Update and lock down your IPMI.** IPMI has been show to be a [serious vulnerability](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/ipmi/) in the past. Use a seperated VLAN, strong password, non-standard username. This is one of these things that WILL be defeated with physical access, unfortunately.

Case in point: as of my writing of this, the PBI jail for Owncloud is stuck at 9.1.2, dating back to November of 2016. To compare, my docker instance of Owncloud is currently on 10.0.7. \\n\\nPlugin jails have been helpful for me and countless others, but it's time to admit that Docker is just better at doing what the original system set out to do. Here's what I've done to transition to Docker on FreeNAS. \\n\\n## Setup\\n\\nSetup is [pretty straight-forward and well-documented in the FreeNAS docs](http://doc.freenas.org/11/vms.html#docker-rancher-vm), however it is described in a very procedural fashion which doesn't really give you any insight of what is being done behind the scene. This makes it very confusing when things break; I was pulling my hair out for hours because of a [corrupt download not completing](https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/freenas-11-1-rancher-server-installation-failed.59898/). For thoroughness' sake, here is an overview of what following the steps in the guide accomplishes:\\n\\n* Creates a Bhyve VM\\n* Creates a RAW drive image that will be used for storage\\n* Downloads the RancherOS image and flashes it (dd?) to your drive image to make it bootable\\n* Creates a basic RancherOS configuration file from the options entered in the additional options entered in the storage device menu.\\n\\nIf you can't get a serial console or can't get the machine to boot properly, remember this order and use it to diagnose. This should be obvious, but the recommendations regard the provisioning of CPU and RAM resources are just that; depending on what you intend on running within your Docker VM, assign system ressources as necessary. In my case, assigning just one VCPU held back [my bitcoin node](https://hub.docker.com/r/ruimarinho/bitcoin-core/) from properly syncing. Adding another one fixed the problem and made all the services running in containers visibly more snappy. \\n\\nA word of warning on giving the VM more system ressources: I had problems giving the machine more than 2 virtual CPUs; the machine seems to want to boot up, with Bhyve init stuff showing up on the serial console, but the OS stalled shortly before all the services could go up. \\n\\n## Storage\\n\\nThe modularity of Docker is what makes its strength, but in order to be truly useful, if must be built on a stack that is itself just as modular. For example, in continuity with the spirit of containerizing, I aught to be able to be able to snapshot and replicate individual containers to back them up locally or offsite. Storing everything on the raw disk image just isn't compatible with that vision of things. \\n\\nYou could store everything on ZFS vdevs through additional VM volume assignments, but then you [lose the ability to snapshot under certain conditions](http://jrs-s.net/2016/06/16/psa-snapshots-are-better-than-zvols/).\\n\\nRancher has [convoy](https://github.com/rancher/convoy) that can make docker volumes persistent, and store them on a variety of backends, but the additional layer of docker-style volumes doesn't really need to be there. \\n\\nI opted instead to use [nfs-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/d3fk/nfs-client/) and bind-mounts in my containers to my install of FreeNAS, [with the method detailed here](https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/howto-freenas-11-rancheros-docker-and-portainer.54595/). I modified the steps to fit my application slightly. First of all, I elected to created a child dataset for every container, in order to be able to snapshot and replicate as mentionned above. Secondly, I had to make seperate NFS shares for each container, since NFS will not traverse nested datasets as one would expect. With this larger amount of shares, listing the NFS mounts was done directly in my cloud-config.yml file, as so.\\n\\n![nfsmounts](/content/images/2018/03/nfsmounts.png)\\n\\nYou might be tempted to use SMB, which is also supported by RancherOS; this isn't a good idea if you plan on running any container that includes Apache because it is heavily reliant on UNIX-style permissions to function properly, and that just won't translate over SMB. \\n\\n## Networking and security\\n\\nUsing NFS as a link between your Docker VM and your ZFS storage introduces security problems caused by the ways that RancherOS and NFS works. First of all, RancherOS runs all it's Docker processes as root along with the NFS client; secondly, NFSv3 uses client-side info on the user accessing the share to determine if it has the permission to access the share or not. All this means that you will have to disable root squashing for things to work; I went about this by adding root/wheel to the maproot user/group fields in the advanced settings of my NFS shares. \\n\\nThis is obviously horrible security, because any rogue machine can now access your shares as root if your client ACLs are too loose. The way around this is making sure that the network access to the address that the NFS service is bound to is impossible for everything but your Docker VM. The advanced settings of the individual NFS shares provide a client allow list, which you should use to whitelist ONLY your VM with its IP. \\n\\nThe ideally you'd also want to use a dedicated network bridge to pass the traffic off between your storage and the VM. The problem is that the web UI does not show you bridge interfaces when offering you the options for VM NIC mapping; my workaround was to plug in a dead-end VLAN in an unused interface on my server, and have all the Docker-related traffic come in through this interface.\\n\\n### A note on pre-11.1-U2\\n\\nGoing from one reboot to the next in the 11.1 series of releases (not U2 though), I've gotten weird networking issues where the networking interface(s) used by the RancherOS instance would not bind to the correct NIC, making connection to the NAS-provided storage or to the rest of the network impossible. Digging around in the bug tracker, it seems that [the way VM NICs are bridge may be sub-optimal](https://redmine.ixsystems.com/issues/27122). If you are experiencing weird issues after configuring your networking in the RancherOS VM, check your network configuration with `ifconfig`. You should get something like this:\\n\\n![freenasifbridge](/content/images/2018/03/freenasifbridge.png) \\n\\nThe TAP interface is the host-side NIC that gives your VM network access. In my setup, the VLAN interface is the parent interface that can be found in the ==Devices/NIC== menu of the VM. If the binding is properly made, the bridge should group those two interfaces together. If you have many TAP interfaces and bridges that you can't make sense of, upgrade to 11.1-U2 and reboot, things should clean up. \\n\\n## Managing Docker\\n\\nRancherOS kind of suggests that using Rancher to manage your containers might be a good idea, but it seemed a bit clumsy and overkill for a single host setup. I instead opted for [Portainer](https://portainer.io), which I was somewhat already familiar with and is much less intimidating to use and deploy, seeing that it's really just a nice front end for the docker commands you you know and love.\\n\\nAt the RancherOS command line, run the installation one-liner on the Portainer website, subsituting bind mounts for the volume if necessary, and adding the restart policy if you so desire. Provided the restart-policy is ok, Portainer will start up with RancherOS bootup. \\n\\n## Monitoring\\n\\nI've been building a monitoring system on the [TICK stack](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/introduction-to-influxdatas-influxdb-and-tick-stack/) for my home setup, and as it turns out Docker monitoring is quite simple. [Telegraf has a plugin specifically for docker monitoring](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/docker), just spin up a Telegraf instance with the docker.sock endpoint mapped through, configure the config file, and you're good to go.  \\n\\nWith the [intergrated Graphite listener](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/services/graphite/README.md) enabled and the ports open, you can also configure FreeNAS to output its metrics to Influx aswell... your Influx instance can of course be within docker if you so desire.\\n\\nIf you want better insights into your NAS' performance and don't have a monitoring setup built up, this \\\"FreeNAS monitoring on itself\\\" is not a bad choice, particularly if your FreeNAS server is your only machine.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you run anything critical, you might want to run a dedicated docker host. However, if you have spare CPU cycles and memory (although with ZFS, it could be argued that there is no such thing as \\\"spare memory\\\"), why not? Docker absolutely seems like a viable replacement for plugin-jails, and if your FreeNAS box is a backup repo for databases hosted elsewhere, you can now run replication services in containers instead pushing dumps. \\n\\nI just wish that Docker was native to the base OS, and that the Bhyve + RancherOS + NFS stack could be avoided. Limits on provisionning hardware are also a bit problematic, but it is what it is. There's a Docker container for everything... have at it!\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I've been a FreeNAS user since the 8.x days, having decided to ditch a self-hosted file server based off Fedora with a pretty basic MDADM + ext3fs storage setup.

Running on commodity hardware, the prior setup was fine, but\nlittle other than an extensible NAS that was somewhat of a hassle to manage and\nkeep updated. FreeNAS and it's plugins jails promised to do most of what I was\ndoing beforehand, in an appliance format that is much easier to maintain.\n\nFreeNAS Corral, aka FreeNAS 10, was supposed to bring native Docker support to\nthe product with the help of a built-in Bhyve + boot2docker setup built right\ninto the new UI. While jails are technically as flexible as FreeBSD and the \nports library [https://www.freebsd.org/ports/] are, plugins-jails are a bit more\ncomplicated and you are generally dependant on a maintainer for updates. Case in\npoint: as of my writing of this, the PBI jail for Owncloud is stuck at 9.1.2,\ndating back to November of 2016. To compare, my docker instance of Owncloud is\ncurrently on 10.0.7.\n\nPlugin jails have been helpful for me and countless others, but it's time to\nadmit that Docker is just better at doing what the original system set out to\ndo. Here's what I've done to transition to Docker on FreeNAS.\n\nSetup\nSetup is pretty straight-forward and well-documented in the FreeNAS docs\n[http://doc.freenas.org/11/vms.html#docker-rancher-vm], however it is described\nin a very procedural fashion which doesn't really give you any insight of what\nis being done behind the scene.

This should be obvious, but the\nrecommendations regard the provisioning of CPU and RAM resources are just that;\ndepending on what you intend on running within your Docker VM, assign system\nressources as necessary. In my case, assigning just one VCPU held back my\nbitcoin node [https://hub.docker.com/r/ruimarinho/bitcoin-core/] from properly\nsyncing. Adding another one fixed the problem and made all the services running\nin containers visibly more snappy.\n\nA word of warning on giving the VM more system ressources: I had problems giving\nthe machine more than 2 virtual CPUs; the machine seems to want to boot up, with\nBhyve init stuff showing up on the serial console, but the OS stalled shortly\nbefore all the services could go up.\n\nStorage\nThe modularity of Docker is what makes its strength, but in order to be truly\nuseful, if must be built on a stack that is itself just as modular.

Here is a few of their latest email subjet lines:\n\n * Your cell phone bill is going up AGAIN\n * FINAL NOTICE: The Internet is counting on you\n * A world without the free and open Internet?\n * The Internet is in danger. Serious danger.\n\nYou get the idea. As one can imagine, they were of the ones who thought that the\nend of net neutrality would mean the end of the internet as we know it.\n\nPolitics, by design, cannot solve the problems they are trying to solve. If\nanything, politics is the cause. So when I needed an unlimited data plan for my\nphone, I didn't send Openmedia a check hoping that their social media ops and\nletter-writing to elected officials who couldn't give less of a shit would give\nit to me; I went to the market, and got exactly what I wanted.\n\nAccording to my research on provider websites and this website\n[https://www.whistleout.ca/CellPhones/Search?minutes=100&sms=100&data=-1&tab=postpaid]\n, none of the big providers have an option for a phone plan with unlimited data,\nwith Sasktel being the only one to offer this; no clue how good their coverage\nis or if they have network deals with other providers. If the big telcos did\nhave a plan, it would be outrageously expensive: Bell's biggest smartphone plan\ncomes with unlimited calls to the US and Canada as well as 16GB of data, limited\nto use within Canada, and will cost you 105$CAD + taxes, which in my home\nprovince of Quebec is 120.75 if you include government theft.\n\nUS carriers however, do have unlimited plans. What's more, they have\nCONTINENT-WIDE unlimited plans, before pre-paid and post-paid, for much less\nmoney. T-Mobile in particular is very good at doing unlimited: their T-Mobile\nOne plan is basically everything, all the time, everywhere.\n\nLast summer,on my way to a visit a friend in Buffalo, I stopped a the first\nT-Mobile booth I could find in upstate New York and got a plan. It's been over\nhalf a year now, and I couldn't be happier. Here's how I did and what to expect.\n\nOpening the account","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-02-09 22:26:39","updated_at":"2019-02-10 03:28:56","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ee934325213bf00017e4251","uuid":"cf4f10e4-951d-4e3b-ac69-a4b4cd601326","title":"Quitter la plantation","slug":"quitter-la-plantation","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/CathFournierQc/status/1105065469344706563\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/CathFournierQc/status/1105168906803662849\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc_8jcHYBis&t=1m4s\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Aujourd'hui, Catherine Fournier a quitté la politique pour les bonnes raisons, et va probablement en payer le prix d'une défaite électorale cuisante aux prochaines élections provincials, en plus de se faire allégrement invectiver jusqu'à la fin de son mandat. \"],[1,[],0,0],[1,[],0,1],[0,[],0,\"Quand on lit les commentaires sur le \"],[0,[0],1,\"statut Twitter qui annonce son départ du PQ\"],[0,[],0,\" ou le \"],[0,[1],1,\"tweet subséquent\"],[0,[],0,\", on comprend rapidement pourquoi elle quitte.

If I'm honest,\nphone-based 2FA is not something I'm too keen on activating anyways, considering\nthe amount of hack attemps that I've seen, in the bitcoin sphere specifically.\nOn iOS, OTP auth allows you to export the OTP seed, which I have backed up\nphysically, and configured on more than one device. That seems like a much\nbetter way of doing things.\n\nMore advanced plans of Azure AD provide more flexiblity for third-party MFA\nproviders, but I haven't tested it yet. Passwordless is supposedly available\nonly with Azure AD Premium subscriptions, and at 5$ a month per user, pricing\nseems a bit steep.
