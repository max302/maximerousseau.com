title: A List of WSS-M2C948-B Compliant Oils for Ford 1.0T Ecoboost Engines
---

My daily driver for the past 2 years has been a 1-owner, pre-owned 2014 Ford Fiesta SFE with the 3-cylinder, 1.0L Ecoboost engine. The car has been great in all regards, extremely reliable in my ~35 000 kms of ownership, extremely easy on gas. Apart from the usual complaints coming from Germans (too much hard plastics in the interior, some odd rattles coming from within the interior trim), it's been a great car. 

It's now out both paid off and out of warranty, and for that reason I am going to start doing the maintenance on it myself, as I have been doing for all my cars. My first hurdle in maintaining the car myself is finding the proper oil. The manual calls for oil that complies with Fords WSS-M2C948-B spec, which is apparently harder to find retail. The thinner grade is apparently recommended for a lot of the newer Ford cars. 

I had to put some effort in finding both the spec and the oils that comply with it, so I thought I'd list them here. 

* **Motorcraft CXO5w20-BSP** (OEM oil, this is what the dealer billed me in all my oils changes)
* [Motul SPECIFIC 948 B 5W-20](https://www.motul.com/us/en-US/products/specific-948b-5w20)
* [Mobil Super 3000 Formula F 5W-20](https://www.mobil.com/english-tr/passenger-vehicle-lube/pds/glxxmobil-super-3000-formula-f-5w20)
* [Liqui-Moly Special Tec F Eco 5W-20](https://products.liqui-moly.com/special-tec-f-eco-5w-20-2.html)
* [Castrol Magnatec Professional E 5W-20](https://msdspds.castrol.com/bpglis/FusionPDS.nsf/Files/ED020851AA5CE16380257E3F000B32CC/$File/BPXE-9WBSZT.pdf)
* [Total Quartz 9000 Future EcoB 5W-20](http://catalog.lubricants.total.com/en/products/bxt/QUARTZ-9000-FUTURE-EcoB-5W-20)
* [Havoline Energy SAE 5W-20](http://media.smorjolja.se/2013/01/havoline-energy-5w20.pdf)

None of these are cheap. If in-store availability is any indication, your friendly neighbourhood mecanic isn't going to stock these either.
