title: People's Party, Libertarianism, and Playing the Game
---

Reading Cody Wilson's "Come and Take It", I remember one line which really shook me as a politically active libertarian. Menicious Moldbug, greeting Wilson at a party, says the following:

>  I hope you’ll get over the anarchism talk soon enough, though. I think you’ll find most libertarianism is just born of a **frustrated will to power**.

Emphasis mine. It hit home both because of my (unsuccessful, in terms of accessing power) political bid(s) and activism, but also because of my interactions with institutionalized libertarianism and parts of our base. I had to define political will to power, both for myself and our movement, and evaluate if I (we) we're really just expressing powerless frustration. 

I personnally have always seen my own political action as a write-off from the get-go, a most likely pointless, fruitless endeavour that was treated more as a ritual sacrifice of my time and ressources than as a means to an end. Maybe this is what our opponents mean when they call libertarianism a cult; my involvement in institutionalized politics was more akin to religious devotion than goal-oriented activism. My will to power, if such a thing exists, was not something I hope to realize politically. One-on-one, maybe a I could convert a few people to our cause, or convince a few jaded right-anarchists of giving me a few hours to help fill out some paperwork. In the end, if political will to power is seizing control of some sort of official state function, our efforts were doomed to be frustrated. Our platform and ideas are and always have been too radical, shake up too many entrenched interests ever to go mainstream. No amount of chatting up folks on the evils of central banking would ever change that. If most libertarians addressed politics the way I did, then Moldbug would be right: our will to power is frustrated by default, by virtue of not pursuing it through political means. 

In our politics, power is concentrated in the institutions, the machine. Politicians assemble teams to operate this machine, and then submit themselves to this or that "democratic" exercise to be handed the keys. The political übermensch is a glorified forklift operator. What makes this power hard to capture is that in order to be the operator of state machinery, you have to play the game. You have to promise to the people, most of them dependant on the machine, that you won't being doing 4 straight years of burnouts with this expensive piece of equipment that they mistakenly view as theirs. You have to promise that you'll drive it thriftily. Of course none of that matters: you're the ones with the keys. 

Libertarians hate the machine. They despise the opportunistic bugmen who beg for the keys. Or at least they should. Then, why are we doing this? Why are we running for office, keeping a party registered, asking for money and votes? The winning hearts and minds argument is fine and good, but nothing about winning hearts and minds requires jumping through the hoops of the electoral system and feigning to beg for the keys. 

Moldbug is right; frustrated will to power is why most are doing this, conciously or not. Maintaining a fringe party alive in many ways is building a cheap copy of the state's machinery, one for which the keys are more easily accessible. We repeat the same game we hate, on a smaller scale, and convince ourselves that this specific game is different. Some people become obsessed with gettings keys, any key. That's when the radicals that we aught to be lose their souls.



I've interacted with Maxime Bernier more than half a dozen times at this point. On a personal level, the guy is solid. The people surrounding him, those who I know of are great folks. But the fact of the matter is that these guys, by virtue of having lived in or around the machine, are familiar with it. They've played the game; no matter how personally amicable they are, this makes them suspicious.
