As of last October, I was awarded of piece of paper that certifies that I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. It took me about a full year's worth of in-between-classes downtime to realize that there are generally two types of people who go through higher education: those who do it for the love of the game and who actually want to learn, and those who want a paper that will give them work. In the humanities,  those two categories can probably be equated to people who have border-line obsession with the stuff they study, and shitlords who don't know what the fuck they're doing in school and who have drank the poisonous Kool-aid that made them think that wasting a few years of their lives getting in debt would land them a good job. How anyone comes to think that surviving a cycle of power-points, binge-studying and vomiting on exam papers for a few years can truly translate to marketable skills is still beyond me... but that's for another post. What concerns me here is this schism between the people who attend higher education to absorb knowledge and view the institution as nothing more than a proper environment to do, and the rest who are just chasing a piece of paper which is in the grand scheme of things is generally worthless.

In the 21st century, two things have been widely democratized: the internet and higher education. In terms of social realities, I believe that those two environments are very comparable: both environments cater to (constructivists might say "create") individuals who are either "normal" in the statistical definition of the term, or outliers. I have already alluded to the forms of those groups in higher education in my introduction. Students who understand school as tool for betterment of their selves, that understand that the simple fact that being enrolled in higher ed does not a student make, and conceive themselves as academics in more than just the occupational sense would make up what I would call <strong>Students</strong>, with a capital S. In my experience in my humanities program, Students tend to agglomerate into groups that reflect their outlier status; this is how you get things like half a dozen people coming up with military procurement puns that only them find funny, or casual discussions of the mechanics of senate reform that would assuredly make common folk (and probably a large majority of Political Science students) about-turn to a more interesting place. These people get dirty looks over what seems to be a heated argument, but is actually just a courteous debate between them. While limiting Students' existence to the realm of nerdiness would be unfair as it implies certain  traits, there is undeniable something nerdy in them, as far as their obsession over their chosen subject of study is, at the very least.

Alas, due to heavy government subsidy of higher education programs and the subsequent devaluation of degrees, not all university students are Students deserving the capital S. Free-floating young adults who have no idea where they want to be in 5 years are now heavily incentivized to continue on to higher education, lured by what probably amounts to the fallacious promise of higher wages and  better futures, the social prestige of being "well-educated" and the aura of what good things stereotypical college-life has to offer. These are the people who stick to the coursework, use and abuse of the good ol' cram and puke, and really only attend if they have to. These are the people you get your grad picture taken with and have no idea they even existed. These are the people who go through a 4 year degree without ever reading a book cover to cover. We'll call those people <strong>Drones</strong>: they do want they need to in order to get the paper; forgetting that the said paper has been commodified to the point of being a slip certifying attendance more than anything else.

I'd argue the internet has also created two such classes of individuals. On one end, there is your average internet user: of no definitive age or sex, who uses the internet as a means rather than an end. This person posts vapid updates to Facebook, instagrams meals/selfies/motivational gym quotes/cute outfits, and is handy around the "regular internet". I would define those people as <strong>Normies </strong>(1), to reuse 4chan lingo.

On the other hand, you have digital natives (ie: millenials) who have a <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/r9k">strong propensity to self-diagnosis of autism</a> (2), understand the internet's deeper nature (3), and have come to treat it for what it is, the best place for sharing whatever would be impossible to share In Real Life (IRL) due to numerous social stigmas. Let's call those Pepes. Mainstream coverage of 4chan has been all over the place in it's mischaracterization of it's users, with descriptions such as the Internet Hate Machine and amalgamation with Anonymous; I don't believe that 4chan is somehow a lair for hate groups and anonymous hackers... using such generalizations

Of course, the description I have just made is archetypical, and there is some amount of gray between both definitions.

Many times, reflecting on conversations that I had either participated in or heard in informal settings, I came to the conclusion as a group, we must look completely autistic to outsiders. We're obsessive-compulsive about our discipline way past the point of cringe-worthiness. What kind of neurotypical human being makes jokes on military procurement?

-Memes by their nature reference knowledge.

-Memes straddle the line between shitposting and

-Memes are politically incorrect.

-Memes are alienating to normies.
