title: 'The Quest for Unlimited Data: How I Escaped Canadian Telcos with a US Provider'
---

Ever since I ran for office in 2015, I've been receiving emails from a policy NGO called [OpenMedia](https://openmedia.org), who works on internet-specific advocacy. They compose their emails in a manner typical of the whining-industrial complex of which they are a part of: the sky is perpetually falling, and only sending money their way or playing into their campaigns is the only way to avert the crisis. Here is a few of their latest email subjet lines:

* Your cell phone bill is going up AGAIN
* FINAL NOTICE: The Internet is counting on you
* A world without the free and open Internet?
* The Internet is in danger. Serious danger.

You get the idea. As one can imagine, they were of the ones who thought that the end of net neutrality would mean the end of the internet as we know it.

Politics, by design, cannot solve the problems they are trying to solve. If anything, politics is the cause. So when I needed an unlimited data plan for my phone, I didn't send Openmedia a check hoping that their social media ops and letter-writing to elected officials who couldn't give less of a shit would give it to me; I went to the market, and got exactly what I wanted. 

According to my research on provider websites and [this website](https://www.whistleout.ca/CellPhones/Search?minutes=100&sms=100&data=-1&tab=postpaid), none of the big providers have an option for a phone plan with unlimited data, with Sasktel being the only one to offer this; no clue how good their coverage is or if they have network deals with other providers. If the big telcos did have a plan, it would be outrageously expensive: Bell's biggest smartphone plan comes with unlimited calls to the US and Canada as well as 16GB of data, limited to use within Canada, and will cost you 105$CAD + taxes, which in my home province of Quebec is 120.75 if you include government theft.

US carriers however, do have unlimited plans. What's more, they have CONTINENT-WIDE unlimited plans, before pre-paid and post-paid, for much less money. T-Mobile in particular is very good at doing unlimited: their T-Mobile One plan is basically everything, all the time, everywhere.

Last summer,on my way to a visit a friend in Buffalo, I stopped a the first T-Mobile booth I could find in upstate New York and got a plan. It's been over half a year now, and I couldn't be happier. Here's how I did and what to expect.
