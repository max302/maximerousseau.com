<a href="http://www.jaredsouney.com/">Jared Souney</a>is a Portland-based photograph and graphics designer who's done a lot of work in BMX and skate.He has been on both my Twitter friends list and RSS reader for a while now. I can't recall where I was linked to him, but I do know that the moment I landed on his site, I bookmarked and grabbed a feed: his stuff is tight. 

He posted a picture that he took of the infamous <a href="http://vimeo.com/2529703">Mt. Baldy spot in Cali</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/jaredsouney">recently on Twitter</a>, telling us that he was going to get it printed. Upon popular demand from the many BMX/skate twits, he just today let a limit amount of the <a href="http://twitter.com/jaredsouney/status/6513968164">Mt. Baldy shirts loose</a> for the public to buy, right off of the Yobeat webstore.

The shirt is sick. One of my non-skater and non-biker friends came up to me as I was ordering mine, and asked me what the heck the shirt was. I was expecting the usual "oh... BMX" kind of reply from him as I explained what exactly Baldy was all about, and to my surprise, he actually commented on how rad it look. I agreed, and happily zapped off a couple of dollars from my Paypal account. 

Like I said, although I don't have a number, Jared has said that this is a very limited run, and that it will be the only series, so you might want to hurry up if you want to get one. <a href="http://yobeat.bigcartel.com/product/mt-baldy-fullpipe-t-shirt">Buy them here off the Yobeat store</a>.
