I've only got one word for this thing: AWESOME!

This marvelously thought up piece of machined aluminum was featured on <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2010/02/bottoms-up-sloganeering-and-engineering.html">BikeSnobNYC</a> last tuesday, and from the moment I saw it I knew I had to get myself one. Ahrens made it easy too, you can order a Wisecracker directly from their website and checkout via Paypal. 

If you're like me and only drink stuff that doesn't come with a twistcap (I sound like such a douche eh?), this is a godsend. As soon as this arrives, my <a href="http://maximerousseau.com/2009/10/26/meet-the-malum/">Malum</a> is getting a taste of it for sure, and I'll be all set to attend all the <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/091305/hipster-party.gif">pompous fixie-riding hipster parties</a> I want. 

<a href="http://www.ahrensbicycles.com/Bottle-Opener.htm">Get yours there</a>.
