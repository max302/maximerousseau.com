If you have seen the pre-crash version of this site, you have probably the carpenting Frankenstein that is the laptop stand that I am currently using. Well, times had changed, and I plan on getting a new desktop with a 20 inch LCD, which will take up some major space on my desk, space that I do not posses at the moment. Sure, Having another computer will relocated my server and IRC box Redbull to some place in a closet, hence freeing my of the clunky <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ibm%20e74&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">IBM E74 CRT</a> that I currently have plugged on it, but the hunk of plywood and MDF that I call a cooler is still a really big piece on my desk. To save all that space that it's using, I have thought up a slimmer stand, made of plexi or acrylic this time.
