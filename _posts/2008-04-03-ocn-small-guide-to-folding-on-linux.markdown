Do you want to start folding for the cure under a linux OS? It's a fact, all machines run work units fast on tweaked linux, so what are you waiting for?

I have compiled a small guide in my free time to get you folding, SMP or not, under linux in less time that you can read this article. Feel free to leave comments.
<blockquote>Twice I've had experiences with folding and Linux: once on an older, slower system where the PPD difference was barely noticeable (2 x 0 is still 0), and another time on Annabel, my new Core 2 based server, in which I made the FAH implementation much cleaner, and I thought I might as well spead the word to y'all. I thought about making an FAQ with this article, but since I don't yet have enough rep to post in the FAQs, I'd figure that I would type it down here until the FAQ's replacement (wiki?) hits the streets.</blockquote>
