Last week was very dull. I never though I would ever go past 40 hours of work during a school week, but I did last week. That's in addition to 20 hours of class. For this week exceptionally, allow me to give you a repost of a reject iPhone pic not uploaded to previous TWiPs that perfectly represents last week's content outside of school and work.
