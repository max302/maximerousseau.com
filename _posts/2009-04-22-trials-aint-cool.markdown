Just in case you don't read Bike Snob on a regular basis, have a look at this.

After such a mind-blowing video, I dare anyone to make fun of trials. I too have always wondered how urban trials rider got kicks from jumping on stuff all day long, but you gotta admit, it's pretty darn impressive. This video isn't your average trials vid either... the dude has some sick street moves, and actually rolls around instead while doing tricks instead of solely going from a low place to a higher one. I've never seen anybody do a 180 to ababuca to 180 on something as thin as a handrail with a BMX (2:19), let alone that incredibly sick flair from a tree to flat which would have made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GZevX6oYmM">Scotty Cramner</a> jealous (3:07).

Trials haters, you've been served.
