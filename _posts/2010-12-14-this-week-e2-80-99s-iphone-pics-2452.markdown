This week's combo, Helga Viking on Blanko.

	<li>The crown jewel of Quebecois cuisine... poutine. This particular specimen is a bacon variant from the <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/1418061">Snack Bar Normanville</a> right next to school. Needless to say, it put an end to my hunger. </li>
	<li>If you've ever been ripped off by a vending machine, you know this scene all too well. Being ripped off by a human being is bad enough... when it's a machine it's just worst.</li>
	<li>New toy! Intel Retail Edge's Holiday Deal gave me the opportunity to upgrade my computer with some SSD hotness for the holiday season. For those who think changing your boot drive isn't going to have much impact on your systems overall performance , you need to try one of these out. Sub 30 second boot times from button press to Windows, lighting fast loading times, web browsing is even more snappy, multi-tasking is awesome. The difference is mind-blowing, well worth the hefty price tag in my opinion. I'll have a post up in a while demonstrating the difference in boot times.</li>
	<li>Couche-Tard (Mac's for all your Anglos) has some of the most awesome advertisement in my opinion. From the border-line provocative ads for <a href="http://www.sloche.com/">Sloche</a> to this insignificant yet hilarious and effective play on words, they keep putting out great ads. </li>
