<ul>
	<li>This wasn't taken in LA, but here in my hometown, Trois-Rivieres. Not sure who's rich enough around here to get around in an Escalade the size of a bus.</li>
	<li>Place Laurier's food court. Natural light is awesome.</li>
	<li> I was kind of being a whore for <a href="http://saymayday.com/">Say Mayday</a> in that one. The everyman's emergency trunk stash: extra threads and condoms. </li>
	<li> Shot some pool for the first time in a while this week, at the <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/6801449">Crystal Billard Lounge</a>. The waitresses are nice, the beer is inexpensive, the place is generally empty except for a couple hockey poolers and pool sharks, the tables are excessively fast, and best of all, they carry Guinness. A couple of pints and you'll be playing like <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa3g5l_begbie-01_shortfilms">Paul fucking Newman</a>.</li>
	<li> Who in there right minds would want a truck on chromed out 24" fake splits? <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/fake%20splits%20can%20fuck%20off/are_ess/fuoff.jpg">Fake splits can fuck off</a>. </li>	<li>I rediscovered Tim Hortons as a tasty, lower cost alternative to Subway for those times when I don't feel like packing a lunch. Salty, but delicious.</li>
