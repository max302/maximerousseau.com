<blockquote>A knife, especially a carry piece, is supposed to be a go-to tool, a dependable object that gets the job done 100% of the time. This knife I am reviewing is NOT that kind of object.

The Camillus CUDA looks cool, and when I took it out of the packaging, I had that same tingly feeling that I get when unboxing just about any new gadget. I had seen Youtube video's of this knife's deployment mechanism. I was sold: AUS8 steel (that's supposed to be good, right?) and looking like a total badass for 40$?!?! YES! Unfortunately, I had been caught in Camillus' marketing Â gimmick; this knife is a total piece of crap.</blockquote>
