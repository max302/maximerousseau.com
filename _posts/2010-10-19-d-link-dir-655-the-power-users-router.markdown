<blockquote>Back in the days it seemed like D-Link made inferior products; in the time where the WRT54 was the king of the castle, D-Link was cheaper made, had a less extensive list of options available from the web interface, and generally was less appealing. Times have changed, thanks to products like the DIR-655.</blockquote>
