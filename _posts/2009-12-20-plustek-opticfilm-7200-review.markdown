I wrote up a more extensive review of my new, much beloved film scanner, a <a href="http://plustek.com/product/7200.asp">Plustek Opticfilm 7200</a>, over at Epinions. Have a read:

<blockquote>I've started shooting film again with an old hand-me-down SLR to practice my skills as a photograph in general, to get myself to think more about each shot before I pull the trigger and refine my aptitudes at quickly aquiring and framing a subject, shooting the right thing at the right time, all that good stuff. Basically, ridding me of the "spray and pray" method that my DSLR had forced me into taking up..

Being a big fan of Flickr and not that big of a fan of stacking 4x3's in shoe boxes, I want to be able to digitize my film snaps and post them along side my digital work online, and have high resolution copies available on my redundant drives for archiving. Most photo labs offer the possibility of scanning your negatives and burning them to a CD at the same time as developing, but I've had horrible experiences with all three places I've tried. Low quality 300dpi jpegs, that's what I get for my 7.99$ additional fee? After being disappointed by all the labs which had up to then made me quite happy, I decided to matters in my own hands and do it myself, so I bought the Plustek Opticfilm 7200.</blockquote>
