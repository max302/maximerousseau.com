Sadly, dued to my bricked wrist and money issues, I am not currently in a position to renew my hosting plan with <a href="http://www.josherickson.org/">Josh</a>, who has been hosting my blog from the start, about 2 years ago.

In order for my blog to not totally go down, I managed to get WP working on my home server after lots of messing around. You can now reach my site at <a href="http://max302.ath.cx/">http://max302.ath.cx/</a>. Be aware that this situation is temporary, which makes it even more frustrating. I'm losing all my linkage, my pagerank, risking my domain, and getting a big chunk of my web presence taken away, which is not fun, specially since I sent out resumes linking to my site to potential employers.

"Oh, how leet is that guy, he has a site... *loads page* *MaximeRousseau.com is unavailable* Wow, just another nooblet."

Not fun. I'll be trying to buy my domain back as soon as I can and point it to my home... but downtime still sucks.

Domain is set to expire on June 4th. Wish me luck.
