<ul>
	<li>Improvised workbench. I've been fixing 'puters this week, and not just at work. Currently working on a transparent proxy running off pfSense, I'll post the results if it ever goes live.</li>
	<li>Flash-storm = mega car-cake. The other side was even worst, it was unreal.</li>
	<li>Old-school Apple gear. Some Apple fanboy hipster would probably fork out a month's worth of food for this baby. It's fully functional!</li>
	<li>I'm still unsure if this is an easter-egg in memtest or actual errors. Pretty cool.</li>
