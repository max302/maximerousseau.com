This week's TWiP had to be delayed due to trouble I had with my phone last week, right in the exam period. A jailbreak package, iRealQuickSMS, managed to somehow corrupt my 3GS' install of iOS4.1, which made me lose all of the GOLDEN content I had racked up despited being buried under school work. Then I also had trouble with importing my previously purchased Hipstapaks.... anyways, this week's stuff is Jimmy on Kodot X-Grizzled.

	<li>Ending the night with Pabst at the <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/863965">Nord-Ouest Cafe</a>. Regardless of what you think about PBR, the fact is that is has a certain alcohol content, it's liquid, and it costs close to nothing. Just what you need when you can't taste anything anyways.</li>
	<li>Whoever did the design on this thing deserves some kind of design prize. Imagine the dude that has to market urinals with a dong designed into it...</li>
	<li>A coworker of mine was playing around with Boxee, turns out YouPorn is a trending channel. THE INTERNET IS FOR PORN!</li>
	<li>People who tote guns generally consume lots of Tim Hortons. Law enforcement is often seen in Timmy's across the nation, and I've personally witnessed a dude fill his car up with Tim's for an entire squadron of officer cadets. It's unreal, it really does become addictive.</li>
</ul>

Happy holidays to all, be safe so you can enjoy next week's batch of iPhone pics that will immortalize what will most probably be my most intoxicated Christmas yet.
