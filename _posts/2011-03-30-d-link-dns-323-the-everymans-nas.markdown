<blockquote>As an in-store technician for a big box retail, I am shocked by how little people are aware of the evanescence of computer storage. Countless times I have seen customers come back with defective hard drives in their 6 month old laptop and be dumbfounded when they are told that their data can not be recovered. Of all the ways that the computer industry has found to make customers spend, it seems that too little effort has been put into making the public aware that hard drives, like all other things, will eventually die, and that when they do, you better be prepared. That's why I am happy to see D-Link come out with a product like the DNS-323 that facilitates practice of safe data storage.
