I'm late again. Surprise. The stupid thing about it was that the image was uploaded on Sunday... meh.
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/5009285423/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5009285423_32f873bc1a.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<ul>
	<li>Charlevoix. It's hilly.</li>
	<li>Don't think that Hipstamatic did the colors on this one.</li>
	<li>Class-mates all singing along. Youth hostels are awesome.</li>
	<li>Sizzurp, but legal. 1 day, triple-dose of syrup, and I was up and running the next day. I strongly recommend it, but I am not responsible if you fuck yourself up. Triple-dose of Nyquil will most probably put you in a coma, play it safe kids.</li>
