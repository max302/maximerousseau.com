Everybody's in the fight for GP-GPUs... and it makes me question Nvidia's ability to survive in such a market, specially when all it's CPU producing friends are openly declaring war.
<blockquote>Nvidia is acting weird lately. Apart from keeping the bar high in the GPU sector, Nvidia seems to be wanting to take over something else, the CPU sector. I'm a bit confused as if they want to do so using CUDA and GPU-powered applications to entirely eradicate the need for a powerful CPU and build crappy replacements of their own, or just trying to beat Intel at their own game, plain and simple, by producing super high end chips.

I might be totally wrong, but in the case that this "<a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/36889/118/" target="_blank">can of whoop ass</a>" turns out to be a flop, this may very well be the end of Nvidia as we know it......</blockquote>
