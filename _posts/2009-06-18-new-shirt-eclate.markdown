Exam period... not much time to update these days. It's gonna slow down though... hopefully enough so that I can manage to ride my bike and write stuff while working enough to afford a fixie. 

Speaking of being able to afford a fixie: I have a new shirt up for sale!

Based off of the éclat logo and font face, this shirt is pretty self explanatory for anybody who speaks French. If not, then éclaté means high. There, you get it.

Get your own printed on demand <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/max302">from my Zazzle store</a>! Just like my other shirt, this comes printed on an American Apparel body-hugging (yet not overly tight) tee. It comes in white for the base price, but add 2 bucks and you can choose from any light color Zazzle offers on this style of shirt! Light blue and pastel green look really nice! 

Already ordered one for myself and one for a buddy. I'll update once I get those. If you order, please do post a link to a photo of you in the shirt on either the comments to this entry, the Zazzle page, or email 'em directly to me! max302@gmail.com!

<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/%C3%A9clat%C3%A9_tshirt-235547725731069164">Product page is here</a>, base price is a meagre 18.95! You can even customize the shirt to your liking with additional graphics or text or whatever else you feel like!
