A very full week, once again. I've grown tired of shuffling the settings on Hipstamatic, so here you go, everything this week was taken with the Helga Viking / Pistil combo.

	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJYY585gcYo#t=0m28s">Batinsse qui mouille ca va neyer l'ble d'inde.</a></li>
	<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJYY585gcYo#t=1m25s">Toujours est-il que ca l'a ete un averse comme qu'on aurait jamais pu en voir de plus grosses. Y moullait, eh qui mouillait! Cala pas d'allure, ca tombait en simonake!</a></li>
	<li> Fall is coming. I aught to load up some of that Kodak ProColor and shoot some stuff in a National Park or something.</li>
	<li>I suffered from a very serious relapse of geeky stuff. The computer recycling place I go to gave me exclusive rights to all the mechanical keyboards that they get in exchange for all the stuff I bring in. I was happy with my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLCLL5O7DnI">Compaq G80 with Cherry Browns</a>, but I am now the proud owner of a classic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMkhakma6VI">Dell Model M (buckling springs)</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj_WrIpDopI">Dell AT101 ( black Alps)</a>. Non-geeks, don't hate... it's not just a very loud keyboard, it a whole different computing experience.</li>
	<li>Playing with fire...</li>
	<li>... putting it out like a man.</li>		
<li>Sextuple-world-champ Frank at the beer-pong table. This guy is a menace.</li>
	<li>Vintage auto spottings are pretty rare in Quebec due to the shitty winters, salt, and even shittier roads. This Jag E-Type was mint, probably fresh out of the paint shop or just after a compound by the looks of it. I love the wire wheels.</li>
