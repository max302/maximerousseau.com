<blockquote>It's by accident that I discovered the Cooler Master Centurion RC-590. When my server was running out of space for hard drives, back in the days where it was built in an Ultra Grid chassis, I set out to find a case that was roomy, yet that could fit in my student budget. Constraints were numerous: I didn't have the space nor the budget to shop around for a full tower case, and most mid towers didn't come with enough 3.25" drive bays to host 8 hard drives. 

I got a link to the RC-590's page on an online merchant from fellow users on an PC enthusiast board when asking for a relatively small case with many drive bays. I couldn't have asked for more: it had more or less the standard dimensions of a mid-tower case, however it's entire front panel was lined with 5.25"  drive bays, which really opened up things for fitting my monster collection of hard drives. The price was right too; at 70 and some odd dollars, it wasn't going to break the bank. And so I ordered. </blockquote>
