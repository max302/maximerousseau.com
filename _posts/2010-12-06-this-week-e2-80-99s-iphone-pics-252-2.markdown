This week, Lucifer on Alfred Infrared. I'm starting to run out of combos.

<ul>
	<li>Boss-man getting his fix of thermal paste. It's this time of year... people flock up to the stores, managers go bat-shit insane.</li>
	<li>Quebecois winter, it's on. If snow keeps falling at this pace my car is going to be due for some tie-rods and e-brake cables pretty soon, muhahahahaha.</li>
	<li>A salvaged iPhone 3G I bought. Originally it was supposed to be a present, but plans have changed and now it's in for a full rebuild and personal use. I really want to get <a href="http://www.idroidproject.org/wiki/Main_Page">iDroid</a> running on the sucker. Silver back panel, front digitizer/screen assembly, and a plethora of random screws and small parts are currently on order, I'll probably make a forum post about the rebuild and link it here.</li>
</ul>

It's exam week! It's the holidays! You know what that means for your's truly... double dosing on school and work simultaneously. Hopefully I won't have to feed you B-roll next week.
