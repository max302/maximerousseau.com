<del datetime="2010-04-22T03:08:05+00:00">I found this user on Youtube about a month ago, and I thought I might share it and give him linkage, because the stuff is outstanding. If you're into photography and the gear used in the latter, you have to check this out.</del>

<del datetime="2010-04-22T03:10:14+00:00">Lilkiwi87, aka Joseph Spina, is a 20 year old pro photographer currently working for the National Geographic. The dude's packing a Master's in Photography, and his education combined with incredible experience from working for the world's most reknown magazine makes him a reference for anything photography. Joseph decided to make his youtube profile into a one stop source for photography tutorials and info on Nikon gear. Despite joining only 6 months ago, Joseph has posted 83+ videos containing outstanding Nikon gear reviews and in-camera how-tos, as well as more general tutorials on photography that can be applied to any camera, concerning stuff from bokeh to how to clean filters correctly. Heck, for you real photography wizzes, he also seems to enjoy giving away high end gear once in a while, making the giveaways into questionnaires that are insanely tough.</del>



<del datetime="2010-04-22T03:10:14+00:00">What I really like is that unlike many big Youtubers, he actually takes the time to respond to many of the comments posted on his video, given they are relevant, and what surprised me most, he gives out his EMAIL (!) on his profile, inviting beginner photographers to ask their questions directly. This guy churns out OUTSTANDING videos, both quality and content wise, yet he keeps it real and stays friendly with the photo noobs like myself.</del>



<del datetime="2010-04-22T03:10:14+00:00">I don't know why he doesn't have over 1k subscribers yet... his stuff is tight.</del>

<del datetime="2010-04-22T03:10:14+00:00"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Lilkiwiguy87">Check out his youtube channel</a>, and be sure to subscribe! You also might be interested in <a href="http://www.photozoid4d.com/">his personal website</a>, which contains a crapload of photography tips, tuts, and articles also.</del>

This guy is full of shit. The DPReview community has time and time again criticized him for his bogus identity and the false information he spreads. While there might be some truth in what the guy says... you're better off listening to other REAL experts.
