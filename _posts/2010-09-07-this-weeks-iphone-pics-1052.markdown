This week was hectic, but I'm starting to get the hang of whipping out my iPhone for pretty much anything that might be of potential photographic interest. 
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maximerousseau/4965936675/"><img width="500px" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4112/4965936675_e20e45eea3_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

From left to right, top to bottom:
<ul>
	<li>Doesn't get any more old school than this. My question is, why do computers always break down while this console has been alive and kicking for almost 20 years?</li>
	<li>Made a purchase this week: BMW style H's. They'll be my summer wheels for the Jetta next summer if I can find somebody who can fill and drill to 4x100. And if I can't.... well I'll just sell 'em for the alloy and make some money off of it. They were that cheap.</li>
	<li>Ebay taillights galor. When confronted with this, do you laugh, cry or puke?</li>
	<li>Grime street in Sherbrooke. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/140_Grime_Street">Kano would be proud</a>.</li>
	<li>Did he lose a bet, or does he just get more pleasant interactions with the public? Either way, this man has guts.</li>
	<li>I really didn't need this. Parking at CEGEPTR is a conspiracy against students for parking rights supremacy.</li>
	<li>Old habits die hard. Not having much time to eat = ingesting crap in a hurry. I need to fix this ASAP.</li>
	<li>The apocalypse cometh. No really, it's true, I read it in the Journal de Montreal, it has to be. </li>
	<li>Doum. He is....</li>
	<li>...a sick and fucking twisted individual.</li>
</ul>
