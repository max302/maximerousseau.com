<ul>
	<li>Typo or cool new way to spell computer?</li>
	<li>Shouts to <a href="http://www.manmadeclothing.com/">Manmade clothing</a>, a little indy brand from New York who screenprints in-house. Ordered two shirts from them the other day, top shelf stuff. </li>
	<li> I can't believe my Daewoo Lanos. Under a grand of repairs and maintenance over more or less 8 years, original brakes, original ignition, original everything basically. Hopefully it stays that way and I won't get <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDinIMBsjsw">killed</a>.</li>
	<li>Couldn't have said it better.</li>
</ul>
Next week is a special week: I'm going on a cruise in the Caribbeans! For this reason, I won't be posting up a TWiP next week, but I'll be back in two weeks!
