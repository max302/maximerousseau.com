Last week was hella hectic, hence the tardiness. From left to right, top to bottom: 

<ul>
	<li>After finishing "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HTIBd8JagPcC&amp;dq=who+won+the+oil+wars%3F&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mEJVa86JG4&amp;sig=DFysN_u-PsFuG7H-pGrAYHl3K0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mXh4TI2_LYSclgfQpuTsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg">Who Won the Oil Wars</a>", I started another book that was given to me when I moved out of RMC. While the theme of the book is without a doubt interesting (I am developing a penchant for international politics), I think I headed into some pretty dry reading, with lots of side-tracks and mid-chapter research on Cold War events I never knew event existed. </li>
	<li>My friends and I developed a taste for smoking a hookah once in a while after getting over our teenage flavored cigar phase.   A local place called "<a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/3619610">Pyramides</a>" gave us a discount rate on a smoke, we jumped on the occasion. Employees there kick ass, excellent post-barhopping grub. </li>
	<li>I hate convertibles with a passion usually. But a Z4 with a hardtop on, I'd make an exception. </li>
	<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuJJAv4VX-E">Enough said</a>. This guy is a legend. </li>
</ul>
