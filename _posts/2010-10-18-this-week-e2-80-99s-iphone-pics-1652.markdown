	<li>RIP Jetta. You were a gigantic money pit, you looked like shit, but you taught me lots. Now that I'm widowed, I think I'll move on to some<del datetime="2010-10-18T01:05:33+00:00">thing</del>body a bit younger, more energetic, with a bigger booty... Jetta Wagon MK4 1.8t?</li>
	<li>I went on a spending spree to forget my loss. I now own both colors of the "<a href="http://shop.animalbikes.com/collections/soft-goods/products/farm-new-era">Farm</a>" New Era by <a href="http://animalbikes.com/">Animal</a>. Yes, I'm that passionated about flat brimmed hats. Total hat count now sits at 9, and desperately need to build myself a rack for all those caps.</li>
	<li>THE PROTEINATOR: Two eggs, processed cheese and shittons of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretons">creton</a> on buttered rye bread. If you can stand the vomit-esque texture that creton has when it's stuck between two hot things (toast and eggs), you have yourself a super meaty snack that's good between any two meals. </li>
	<li>Original gangstas, straight outta St. Jean.</li></ul>
