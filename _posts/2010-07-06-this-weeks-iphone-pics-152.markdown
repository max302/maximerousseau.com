I'm not going to lie, this concept was <del datetime="2010-07-06T01:31:54+00:00">stolen</del> very strong inspired by Nuno Oliveira's own <a href="http://olivejuuuuice.com/index.php?s=The+Week+in+iPhone+Photos">"The Week in iPhone Photos"</a> series. I've always wanted to start a photography project like a <a href="http://content.photojojo.com/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/">365</a>, but with my erratic shooting phases, the annoy particularity of film of being hard (harder, longer at least?) to process, I had never had the guts to undertake such a project. With this weekly stuff, I'm setting not limit be it a maximum or a minimum, as long as I'm getting something out on my blog every week. So here it is, my very first entry for my very first "This Week's iPhone Pics", TWiP for short.
