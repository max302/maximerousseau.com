<blockquote>If you know gaming peripherals, chances are that you have owned a G5 by Logitech. This mouse, one of the best selling "gaming" mice out there, has become a true classic on internet forums and gaming groups because of it's relatively low price, excellent handling and comfort, and awesome set of features and kick-butt software. After two generations (3?) and many special editions of this venerable peripheral, Logitech has decided to retire the veteran G5 and introduce it's updated offspring the G500. I say offspring because it looks and feels like a cross between the more "business" MX series and the G series. Check it out.</blockquote>
