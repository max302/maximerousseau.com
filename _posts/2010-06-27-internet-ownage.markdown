It never get's old. I'm not going to lie, I appreciate getting into arguments with people over the internet (or over any other medium really), and I get kicks out of winning. How doesn't. The latest to respond to my provocation was photographer, middle-aged man and <a href="http://twitter.com/scottbourne">twitter</a> big-shot <a href="http://scottbourne.com/">Scott Bourne</a>. (Yes Scott, I'm still giving you link love, I hope we can still be friends!)

Mr. Bourne is an apparently very successful self-employed photographer who runs <a href="http://photofocus.com/">Photofocus.com</a> who recently bought a Dodge Challenger SRT8, and has been keeping his readers aware of the mods he has been outfitting his new vehicle with via Twitter. From the very start, I'm not an <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947356,00.html">American car</a> kind of guy, but I made no comment. His latest tweet about his new mirror decals however needed to be called out.

The outcome: I am blocked from following his twitter profile and can therefore no longer enter his camera gear draws. But on the bright side, my remarks did earn me two followers.
