	<li>The traditional Christmas phone call to all the relatives down south in Florida on my mother's side. This year, my grandma discovered speakerphone, so instead of hollering at the other person so they could speak to whichever relative, everybody was screaming at the phone together!</li>
	<li>After almost a year fit as fiddle, I had to catch a cold right in the harshest time of the year at work. I've been drinking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan">DXM</a> sizzurp (in non-insane dosage) for the past week, and it got me back on track real fast!</li>
	<li>Boxing day at work, enough said.</li>
	<li>Tech room locked and loaded with hundreds of thousands of dollars of heavily discounted laptops, ready to roll out.</li>
</ul>
